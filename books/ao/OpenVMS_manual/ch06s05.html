</p><p>ALIGNSIZE=blocks specifies in number of 512-byte-blocks, the alignsize of
the journal file.</p><p>Since a journal file consits of a sequential stream of journal records
each of varying size, it is not easy normally to detect the beginning of the
last valid journal record in an abnormally terminated journal file (for
example, system crash). To facilitate journal recovery in such
circumstances, the GT.M run-time system ensures that offsets in the journal
file which are multiple of ALIGNSIZE (excepting offset 0 which houses the
journal file header) will always be the beginning of a valid journal record.
In order to ensure this, GT.M run-time system writes padding data (if
necessary) in the form of ALIGN journal records just before the ALIGNSIZE
boundary. These ALIGN records also help in skipping past invalid records in
the middle of a journal file allowing MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>EXTRACT <span>/</span>FORWARD <span>/</span>FULL to extract as much data of a
corrupt journal file as possible.</p><p>If the specified ALIGNSIZE is not a perfect power of 2, it is rounded up
to the nearest power of 2.</p><p>The default ALIGNSIZE value is 128 blocks (=64 kilobytes) and the minimum
value is 32 blocks (=16 KiloBytes). The maximum value is 4194304 (=2

recovery to use and hence slows backward recovery down so drastically that a
value of 4194304 causes backward recovery (in case of a crash) to take as
much time as forward recovery on that journal file.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>ALL[OCATION]=blocks</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>ALLOCATION=blocks specifies in 512 byte-blocks, the
initial size of the journal file allocated on creation. Because,
frequent journal file extensions degrade run-time performance, make
journal file allocation ample for a production database.</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>GT.M issues informational messages to the system log whenever the free
space available is not much more than the extension size. GT.M provides
these extension checks as an operational aid for identifying, before space
runs out, that a file system holding the journal file is low on space. When
there is no more free space available on the file system holding a journal
file, GT.M shuts off journaling for the corresponding database file.</p><p>The default ALLOCATION value is 100 blocks. The minimum value allowed is
10. The maximum value is 8,388,607 (4GB-512 bytes, the maximum journal file

2048 (number of blocks needed to have 64 ALIGNSIZE boundaries each 16 KB,
which is the minimum ALIGNSIZE). If the AUTOSWITCHLIMIT value is less than
the sum of allocation and extension values, an error is issued. If the
difference between the AUTOSWITCHLIMIT and the allocation value is not a

<span class="emphasis"><em>BU[FFER_SIZE]=blocks</em></span>
</p><p>BUFFER_SIZE=blocks specifies, in 512-byte blocks, the amount of memory

modify BUFFER_SIZE. Therefore, this option cannot be used to change the
current journal-buffer-size as part of an online switch of the journal

required to hold one GDS database block. The maximum is 2000 blocks. The
default value is 128 blocks.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>EP[OCH_INTERVAL]=seconds</em></span>
</p><p>EPOCH_INTERVAL=seconds specifies the elapsed time interval between two
successive EPOCHs. An EPOCH is a checkpoint, at which all updates to a
database file are committed to disk.</p><p>A smaller EPOCH_INTERVAL reduces the time to recover after a crash at the
cost of increased I/O load on the run-time system (due to more frequent
checkpoints). A larger EPOCH_INTERVAL has the opposite effect.</p><p>The default EPOCH_INTERVAL value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). The minimum
value is 1 second. The maximum value is 32,767 (one less than 32K) seconds,
or approximately 9.1 hours.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>EX[TENSION]=blocks</em></span>
</p><p>EXTENSION=blocks specifies the size of the journal file extension
performed when the file expands and becomes full.</p><p>

</p><p>

<span>Every
extension triggers a check of free space available on the device used
for the journal file. GT.M issues informational messages to the system
log whenever the free space available is not much more than the
extension size. GT.M provides these extension checks as an operational
aid for identifying, before space runs out, that a file system holding
the journal file is low on space. When there is no more free space
available on the file system holding a journal file, GT.M shuts off
journaling for the corresponding database file.</span>
</p><p>The <span>Allocation and extension</span> values determine
when a check is done on the filesystems to see if it has enough space to
hold an extension worth of journal data. When a journal file reaches the
size specified by the sum of ALLOCATION and any multiple of EXTENSION, GT.M
checks the file system for room, and if the available space is less than
three times the EXTENSION, it writes warnings to the operator log. GT.M
provides these extension checks as an operational aid for identifying,
before space runs out, that a file system holding the journal file is low on
space. When there is no more free space available on the file system holding
a journal file, GT.M shuts off journaling for the corresponding database
file.</p><p>The default EXTENSION value is 100 blocks. The minimum EXTENSION is zero

<span class="emphasis"><em>F[ILENAME]=journal filename</em></span>
</p><p>F[ILENAME]=journal filename, specifies the name of the journal file.
FILENAME is incompatible with SET <span>/</span>REGION, if more than one region is specified.</p><p>

</p><p>The default value for the journal-option is based on the following
convention:</p><p>If the database has a dat extension, the basename of the database filename
is taken as the basename for the journal file with an extension of mjl. For
example, database name mumps.dat results in a default name mumps.mjl. If the
database filename does not have a dat extension, the full database filename
is taken replacing ALL occurrences of periods (.) with underscores (_) with
an extension of mjl. For example, database name mumps.acn results in a
default name mumps_acn.mjl.</p><p>Therefore, a journal file always has an extension of mjl. If the new
journal filename (the one specified in the FILENAME option or the default)
already exists, the existing file is renamed with the string
"_YYYYJJJHHMMSS" appended to the existing file extension where the string
denotes the time of creation of the existing journal file in the following
format:</p><pre class="programlisting">YYYY           4-digit-year                                    such as 2001
JJ             3-digit-Julian-day (between 1 and 366)          such as 199
HH             2-digit-hour in 24 hr format                    such as 14
MM             2-digit minute                                  such as 40
SS             2-digit seconds                                 such as 30</pre><p>Assuming the above example for the string value, a journal file mumps.mjl
might be renamed to mumps.mjl_2001199144030.</p><p>If GT.M detects that the rename-logic yields a filename that already
exists, the string "_N[N[N[N...]]]" is appended to the renamed filename
where "N[N[N...]]" denotes the sequence of numbers</p><p>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,990,991,...</p><p>Numbers from the above sequence are tried in that order until a
non-existing rename-filename string is found.</p><p>Taking the same example as above, in case mumps.mjl_2001199144030 and
mumps.mjl_2001119144030_0 already exists, the rename string would be
mumps.mjl_2001199144030_1.</p><p>If the existing file renaming scheme or the default journal file naming
scheme discussed above results in a filename longer than 255 characters (due
to the suffix creation rules), GT.M issues an error and turns off journaling
(and replication, if it is active).</p><p>For journal recovery purposes, a field is maintained in every journal
file&#8217;s header that stores the name of the previous generation journal file
for the same database file. When a MUPIP SET changes the journal state from
DISABLED or OFF to ON, GT.M creates new journal files with no previous
generation journal file name. This indicates that this is a fresh start of
journaling for the particular database. When journaling is already ON, and
GT.M is implicitly (due to AUTOSWITCHLIMIT being reached) or explicitly (due
to MUPIP SET JOURNAL) required to create new journal files, GT.M maintains
the previous generation journal filename (after any appropriate rename), in
the new journal file&#8217;s header.</p><p>In all cases where journaling is ON both before and after a journal file
switch, the previous generation journal file name is maintained in the new
journal file's header excepting the following cases, where it is
cleared:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>If the new journal file is being created due to an implicit switch

returns an error status and makes no change to the journaling state of
the database. This is done in order to avoid possible cycles in the
back-links (such as, a3.mjl has a back-link to a2.mjl which in turn has
a back-link to a1.mjl which in turn has a back-link to a3.mjl thereby
creating a cycle). Cycles could prevent journal recovery. Also note that
cycles in back-links are possible only due to explicit FILENAME
specifications and never due to picking up existing FILENAME
characteristics from the database or by using the default
FILENAME.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Specification of SYNC_IO causes every WRITE to a journal file to be
committed directly to disk. On high-end disk subsystems (for example, those
that include non-volatile cache and that consider the data to be committed
when it reaches this cache), this might result in better performance than
the NOSYNC_IO option.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="SET /JOURNAL Examples"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="set_jrnl_exmpl"></a>SET <span>/</span>JOURNAL

CUS.DAT with a journal buffer size of 64KB (=128blocks) and establishes its

current Global Directory and gives each journal file an ALLOCATION of 50000 RMS
blocks and an EXTENSION of 5000 RMS blocks. If the regions have significantly
different levels of update, either set the ALLOCATION and EXTENSION in the
Global Directory before the MUPIP CREATE(s) or use several MUPIP SET /FILE or
/REGION commands.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">MUPIP SET /REGION /JOURNAL=BEFORE (*)</pre><p>This command activates journaling with before-images for all regions
of the current Global Directory that have previously had journaling enabled.
This activation occurs the next time the associated database file is

<span class="emphasis"><em>

</p><p>The purpose of the optional <span>/</span>BKUPDBJNL qualifier is to define the journaling characteristics
of the BACKUP database. This qualifier must be used if the backup database is to
be opened at the same time in the same environment as the original database.
This is because two database files cannot share a single journal file.</p><p>A value of DISABLE indicates journaling is disabled in the backup database. A
value of OFF indicates journaling is turned off in the backup database. Only one
of the qualifiers DISABLE or OFF can be specified at any given point in

<span class="emphasis"><em>
<span>/</span>[NO]NEWJNLFILES[=[NO]PREVLINK]</em></span>

<span>/</span>NEWJNLFILES causes a
transaction-consistent set of new journal files to be created, for database
files in the backup. All established journaling characteristics apply to the new
journal files. This qualifier is effective only for an ONLINE backup (the
default), when the database has journaling enabled. The <span>/</span>NEWJNLFILES qualifier can take on the
following two values:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>PREVLINK (the default value), to indicate that there should be back

newly created journals and current journals.</p></li></ul></div><p>Specification of the <span>/</span>NEWJNLFILES qualifier causes new journal files to be created as if a
MUPIP SET <span>/</span>JOURNAL=(ON,
xxxx) command was specified. Where xxxx is BEFORE_IMAGES or NOBEFORE_IMAGES
based on the current database characteristics.</p><p>The <span>/</span>NONEWJNLFILES
