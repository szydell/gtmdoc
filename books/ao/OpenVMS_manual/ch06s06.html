<span class="emphasis"><em>/EX[TRACT][=file-specification]</em></span>
</p><p>Specifies that JOURNAL should transfer the contents of one or more journal
files to a single output file in a format intended for processing by an M
program. For a description of <span>/</span>EXTRACT output record formats, refer to the Journal Extract
Formats section later in this chapter.</p><p>
<span>/</span>EXTRACT takes an
optional argument, which provides an output file-specification. If the output
file specification is not provided, MUPIP JOURNAL derives the output file
specification of the extract file using the name of the first journal file that
is processed in the forward processing phase and a file type of .mjf. Note that,
if multiple journal names are specified in the command line the first journal
specified might be different from the first journal processed in the forward
phase. When <span>/</span>EXTRACT is
specified with <span>/</span>RECOVER
(or <span>/</span>ROLLBACK), the
<span>/</span>JOURNAL command
extracts all the journal records processed during a <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>FORWARD command or the forward phase
of (<span>/</span>RECOVER or <span>/</span>ROLLBACK) <span>/</span>BACKWARD command.</p><p>When used independent of <span>/</span>RECOVER (or <span>/</span>ROLLBACK), <span>/</span>EXTRACT option can produce a result even though the
database file does not exist, although it does try to access the database if it
is available. If accessing the database errors out for some reason, the contents
of the journal file can still be extracted by temporarily renaming or moving the
database file.</p><p>If globals in the database have collation enabled, their collation information
is stored in the global variable tree of the database and not in the journal
file. A journal extract of such globals without the presence of the
corresponding database will not be meaningful as the MUPIP JOURNAL command has
no way of knowing just from the journal files if the globals are collated, and
hence will extract them as if they were uncollated.</p><p>Note that, a broken transaction, if found, is extracted to a broken
transaction file (refer to the section on <span>/</span>BROKENTRANS for details), and all future complete
transactions are considered as lost transactions, and are extracted to a lost
transaction file (refer to the section on <span>/</span>LOSTTRANS for details). </p><p>To avoid broken transaction or lost transaction processing and instead extract
all journal records into one file, use the control qualifier <span>/</span>FENCES=NONE. It is strongly
recommended not to use <span>/</span>FENCES=NONE if <span>/</span>RECOVER or <span>/</span>ROLLBACK is also specified.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>
<span>/</span>RECOVER</em></span>
</p><p>Instructs the JOURNAL command to replay database updates from the specified
journal file into the appropriate database. <span>/</span>RECOVER initiates the central JOURNAL operation for
non-replicated database. JOURNAL commands may specify <span>/</span>RECOVER alone, or with other action
qualifiers except <span>/</span>ROLLBACK.</p><p>If a transaction is found with incomplete fence, it is considered broken.
During forward phase of recovery, if a complete transaction (fenced or unfenced)
is found after a broken transaction. <span>/</span>RECOVER increments the error count. If <span>/</span>ERRORLIMIT is reached, the complete
transaction goes to lost transaction file, otherwise, it is applied to the
database. </p><p>All broken and lost transactions are made available as the result of the
<span>/</span>RECOVERY. They are
written as journal extract format in two different text files. They are the
broken transaction file and the lost transaction file. Refer to the sections on
BROKENTRANS and LOSTTRANS control qualifier.</p><p>When performing JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER with fences (FENCES="PROCESS" or FENCES="ALWAYS"), it is
essential for the command to include all the journal files corresponding to the
complete set of database files that make up the logical database. If the
specified set of journals is incomplete, the recovery reports all transactions
that included any missing region as broken. Typically, this means that the
results of the recovery are unsatisfactory or even unusable. </p><p>MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER
requires exclusive access to database files before recovery can occur. It keeps
the exclusive access to the database files, which means that the database files
become inaccessible during the time of recovery.</p><p>For direction qualifier <span>/</span>FORWARD, if the target database's current transaction number is
less than first transaction number to be processed in the specified journal file
for that region, <span>/</span>RECOVER
attempts to include previous generation journal file(s) in its processing,
unless the <span>/</span>NOCHAIN
qualifier is specified. Following the successive previous links of journal files
<span>/</span>RECOVER tries to
include previous generations of journal files until the transaction number when
the journal file was created is less than, or equal to that of the target
database. <span>/</span>RECOVER issues
one or more informational messages when it includes previous generation journal
files. </p><p>If target database's current transaction number is not equal to the first
transaction number of the earliest journal file to be processed for a region,
<span>/</span>RECOVER exits with an
error, unless <span>/</span>NOCHECKTN
is used. If multiple journal files for a single region are specified in a MUPIP
JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>FORWARD command it behaves as
if <span>/</span>NOCHAIN was specified.
If the journal files are not a complete set (for example mumps1.mjl, &amp;
mumps3.mjl were specified, with mumps2.mjl missing from the command line), MUPIP
JOURNAL errors out since the journal files specified are discontinuous in terms
of database transaction numbers. On the other hand, specifying just mumps3.mjl
automatically includes mumps2.mjl and mumps1.mjl in the recovery. </p><p>Forward recovery ignores the current journaling state of the target database
file. It disables journaling of the target database file, (if currently ENABLE
and ON), while playing forward the database updates. However, it restores the
journaling state of the database at the end of a successful recovery (if
necessary), except when journaling is ENABLE'd and ON before the recovery. In
the latter case, the journaling state at the end of a successful recovery, is
switched to ENABLE and OFF. No journaling is performed for the logical updates
to the database for JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>FORWARD.</p><p>For direction qualifier <span>/</span>BACKWARD, the target database file should be the same as when
GT.M wrote the last complete transaction to the journal. Because the database
may be in an indeterminate state due to a failure, exact checks for this match
are not possible. If the target database has journaling DISABLE'd (or ENABLE,
OFF), <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD exits with an error
message. </p><p>If the target database has journaling ENABLE, ON, but the journal file name in
database file header does not match the latest generation journal file name
specified for that region, <span>/</span>RECOVER exits with an error. </p><p>During forward phase of JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD MUPIP journals the logical updates to the database. It also
creates before images. It is always required to have journaling ENABLE'd and ON
for <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD or <span>/</span>ROLLBACK.</p><p>If time qualifiers are not specified, MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER (or <span>/</span>ROLLBACK) <span>/</span>BACKWARD does an optimal recovery
(processing records for the minimum period that is required to assure a proper
recovery). <span>/</span>RECOVER
<span>/</span>BACKWARD may need to
include some previous generations of journal files based on time qualifier
(implicit or explicit). It issues appropriate messages whenever such inclusions
occur. At the end of backward recovery, the journaling state of the database
stays ENABLE, ON.</p><p>When a database file is rolled back by <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD, the corresponding journal file is also rolled back so
that the two are synchronized. <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD then creates a new journal file. If no forward play of
journal records is neccessary, the newly created journal file stays empty and
the database points to the new journal file. The values for journal allocation
and extension in the new journal file, are copied over from the database. The
autoswitchlimit value in the new journal file is the maximum of the
autoswitchlimit values of all journal files from the latest generation journal
file until the turnaround point journal file generation (turnaround point is the
point in the journal file where backward processing stops and forward processing
begins). The journal allocation/extension values in the new journal file are
picked up from the earliest generation of the set of those journal files sharing
the maximum autoswitchlimit value.</p><p>A prefix rolled_bak_ is added to the journal file, whose entire contents are
eliminated (rolled back) by a <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD. These files are not used by GT.M after the MUPIP JOURNAL
<span>/</span>RECOVER, and can be
moved/deleted as needed.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>
<span>/</span>ROLLBACK</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>/</span>ROLLBACK initiates the
central JOURNAL operation for replicated databases. MUPIP JOURNAL commands may
specify <span>/</span>ROLLBACK alone or
with other action qualifiers, but not with <span>/</span>RECOVER. If you do not use the <span>/</span>FETCHRESYNC qualifier, the database
rolls back to the last consistent state. Only asterisk (*) qualifier is allowed
for the journal file selection, that is, <span>/</span>ROLLBACK does journal file selection by itself. MUPIP
JOURNAL <span>/</span>ROLLBACK requires
exclusive access to database files before recovery can occur. It keeps an
exclusive access to the database files, that is, these database files are
inaccessible during the <span>/</span>ROLLBACK operation.</p><p>
<span>/</span>ROLLBACK <span>/</span>BACKWARD exits with an error
message for following conditions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Any database region corresponding to a journal file processed has

logical transactions made up of database updates preceded by a TSTART or ZTSTART

<span class="emphasis"><em>
<span>/</span>FU[LL]</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>/</span>FULL when used with
<span>/</span>EXTRACT qualifier
specifies that all journal records be extracted. A journal file's contents can
be rolled back in case of backward recovery or rollback (refer to RECOVER or
ROLLBACK sections for details) in order to keep the database and journal in
sync. This is achieved not by truncating the contents of the journal file but
instead setting a field in the journal file header, which shows up as "Prev
Recovery End of Data" in a MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>SHOW=HEADER output, to indicate the end of the journal
file before rolling back and setting another field in the file header to
indicate the new end of the journal file (this field shows up as "End of Data"
in a MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>SHOW=HEADER output). Once a journal file's contents are rolled back,
all future MUPIP JOURNAL commands (including <span>/</span>EXTRACT) operate on the rolled back journal file only.
But if <span>/</span>FULL is specified
along with <span>/</span>EXTRACT, the
entire journal file contents (including those records that were rolled back) are
extracted. This qualifier is to be used only as a diagnostic tool and not in
normal operation.</p><p>

<span>/</span>NOINTERACTIVE
terminates the journal processing as soon as the MUPIP JOURNAL command generates
the number of errors specified in <span>/</span>ERROR_LIMIT.</p><p>This qualifier is applicable only to interactive mode or terminal mode. The

<span class="emphasis"><em>

</p><p>
<span>/</span>LOSTTRANS is an
optional qualifier for <span>/</span>RECOVER, <span>/</span>ROLLBACK and <span>/</span>EXTRACT. If this is not specified and a lost transaction file
creation is necessary, MUPIP JOURNAL creates one using the name of the current
journal file being processed with a .lost extension.</p><p>Any complete transactions after a broken transaction is considered a lost
transaction. They are written into the lost transaction file. For <span>/</span>RECOVER it might be
considered as good transaction and applied to the database, if <span>/</span>ERROR_LIMIT qualifier allows it to do
so.</p><p>Note that, if selection qualifiers are specified, the broken transaction
determination (and therefore lost transaction determination as well) is done
based on the journal file that is filtered by the selection qualifiers. This
means that a transaction&#8217;s journal records may be considered complete or broken
or lost, depending on the nature of the selection qualifiers. Using <span>/</span>FENCES=NONE along with the
selection qualifiers will result in every journal record to be considered
complete and hence prevent broken or lost transaction processing.</p><p>In the case of a replicated database, lost transaction can have an additional
cause. If failover occurs (that is, the primary source server, A, fails and the
secondary source server, B, assumes the primary system's role), some
transactions committed to A's database may not be reflected in B's database.
Before the former primary becomes the new secondary these transactions must be
rolled back. These transactions are known as "lost transactions". Note that
these are complete transactions and different from a broken transaction. MUPIP
JOURNAL <span>/</span>ROLLBACK stores
extracted lost transactions in the extract-file specified by this qualifier. The
starting point for the search for lost transactions is the journal sequence
number obtained from the primary source server in the <span>/</span>FETCHRESYNC operation.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>

with <span>/</span>RECOVER.</p><p>The file-pair-list consists of one or more pairs of <span>file-specification</span>
 separated by commas (,). The pairs are separated
by an equal sign in the form:</p><p>(old-file-specification=new-file-specification)</p><p>where the old <span>file-specification</span>

is to <span>/</span>EXTRACT the

recovery. This approach permits the application logic to appropriately handle
any interactions between the removed and the retained transactions. Note that,
selection qualifiers might result in only a subset of a fenced transaction's
journal records to be extracted (for example, a TSTART record may not be
extracted because the first update in that transaction was filtered out by a
selection qualifier, while the corresponding TCOMMIT record may get extracted).

GT.M, the label is GDSJEX01 for a simple journal extract file. This label is
necessary to identify the format of the file.</p><p>Label is followed by journal record extracts. <span>/</span>EXTRACT output records are
constructed of fields or pieces delimited by a back slash (\). The first piece
of an <span>/</span>EXTRACT output
record contains a two-digit decimal transaction record type (for example, 01 for
a process initialization record). The second piece contains the full date and
time of the operation, represented in the $HOROLOG format. The third piece
contains the database transaction number at the time of writing this journal
record. The fourth piece contains the process ID (PID) of the process that
performed the operation, represented as a decimal number. The remainder of the
record depends on the record type. The fields described as "database transaction
number" contain a GT.M assigned number, which uniquely identifies the
transaction within the time covered by the journal file.</p><p>Records of type SET, KILL, ZKILL, TSTART, and TCOMMIT include the token_seq as
part of the output. It is the sixth field in the output of the journal record
extract. When replication is in use, token_seq is a journal sequence number
(jsnum) that uniquely identifies each transaction (for more information on
journal sequence number, see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Database Replication">Chapter 7: &#8220;<i>Database Replication</i>&#8221;</a>). When
replication is not in use and the transaction is a TP or ZTP transaction,
token_seq is an 8-byte token that uniquely identifies the entire TP or ZTP
transaction. For non-replicated, non-TP, and non-ZTP journal records, token_seq
is zero (0).</p><div class="sect3" title="Type 01 - Process Initialization Record"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="type01_proc_init_rec"></a>Type 01 - Process Initialization Record</h4></div></div></div><p>A Type 01 record indicates a process/image-initiated update into the
