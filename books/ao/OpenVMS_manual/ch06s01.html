You may choose to journal
some, all, or none of your database files.</p><p>Use the following descriptions of journaling functionality to choose the best
approach for your organization.</p><div class="sect2" title="Types of Issues Addressed with Journaling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="types"></a>Types of Issues Addressed with Journaling<a class="indexterm" name="id3236975"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>M database management ensures that multiple concurrent updates and retrievals
of the same information (or information "close together" in ordered sequence)
are handled in a predictable and logical fashion. Sometimes the database manager
may have to change multiple records, usually indices, as a result of a single
update. Interrupting a process that is performing such a "multi-point" update
violates a design assumption of the M implementation and also results in a
malformed database. Under normal operation, the database logic handles
interruptions by deferring their recognition until the update is complete.
However, occurrences such as power failures  can cause such interruptions. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Advantages of Journaling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advatages"></a>Advantages of Journaling<a class="indexterm" name="id3235122"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>When a computer system crashes, the database can be left in a transient state
that is damaged. Continuing to use such a database can result in unexpected and
undesirable results; including system hangs, incorrect results, the faulty
application of business logic, as well as further damage to the database.
Journaling can provide for automated recovery and repair of the database,
eventually eliminating the need for manual repair.</p><p>Advantages of journaling options include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Automatic "replay" of work to the last committed update recorded in a
journal file. Note that with the use of transaction processing and
journaling, GT.M provides full ACID properties.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Quick recovery options, such as processing only the information
recorded immediately prior to failure. </p><p>For example, you can recover just the last minute of work instead of
replaying the entire journal file.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Recorded database updates formatted appropriately for processing by an
M program.</p><p>For example, MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>EXTRACT outputs records specified by time, user,
the process identification number, global variable, process name, and
transaction type. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Identification of processes active when the system failed.</p><p>The <span>/</span>SHOW
qualifier identifies these processes, as well as what transactions were
not completed, and other information about the database updates and
processes contained in the journal file. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Disadvantages of Journaling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages of Journaling<a class="indexterm" name="id3237130"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>While journaling is generally a valuable safeguard in protecting your work,
there are issues that may deter you from invoking it.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Journaling requires additional CPU cycles, memory, and disk access.
This can impact application performance.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Journaling may duplicate features already built into your
applications. In that case journaling provides no additional value to
your organization.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A journal file has questionable value in the case where the database
and the journal share a common point of failure that affects the
information in both over a significant period of time. This can be
addressed by using different disks and different disk controllers (where
possible) for the journal and the associated database files.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Additional Considerations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id3237012"></a>Additional Considerations<a class="indexterm" name="id3237054"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>Without journaling, the most common method of recovery is to load a backup
copy of the database and then re-enter the work completed since the backup was
made. </p><p>Most of the overhead costs associated with recovering from a failure usually
derive from maintaining a state of preparedness for the manual recovery, and the
potential risk to the organization from damage to the information during the
relatively infrequent and "abnormal" handling of a recovery. Therefore, you must
weigh the cost of reduced computer throughput or, alternatively, the additional
hardware to support journaling with the same level of performance, against the
reduced likelihood of a prolonged manual re-entry with its associated
drawbacks.</p><p>Some users may journal only heavily updated globals. However, since
infrequently changed globals generate little additional load and may present
significant control problems if not journaled, you may decide that these globals
should also be journaled to maintain application integrity.</p><p>You can use other means to recreate those globals that contain only static
information or process-local (temporary) information. Given the disk space and
disk channel overheads associated with journaling, there is a significant
performance benefit to separating globals that fit either of these categories
into separate database files that do not require journaling. </p><p>When databases contain only temporary information, they can be deleted and
recreated with MUPIP CREATE during a recovery. In the unlikely event that a
failure damages truly static files, the files can be restored from backups
without journal recovery.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 6.
