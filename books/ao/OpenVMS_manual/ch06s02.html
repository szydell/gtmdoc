critical choice is deciding whether and how to use journal fences. Another is how to
manage the journal files in coordination with an appropriate database backup scheme.
Whether or not to use replication affects these choices.</p><p>The following sections address these journaling topics in more detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="Fencing Transactions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id3227006"></a>Fencing Transactions<a class="indexterm" name="id3237234"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>The programming practice of fencing logical transactions protects database
integrity during a system interruption. A logical transaction is a logical unit
that is not complete unless all parts of the transaction are captured. For
instance, the logical transaction "transfer funds between accounts" consists of
a debit update to one account and a credit update to another account.</p><p>Establishing fences around a logical transaction assures that the transaction
is committed as a unit, thereby avoiding logical inconsistencies. These logical
inconsistencies, sometimes referred to as application-level database integrity
problems, manifest themselves as run-time errors, inappropriate branching, and
incorrect reports.</p><p>In GT.M, there are two methods of defining application transaction boundaries.
One method is using the transaction commands TSTART and TCOMMIT. The other
method uses the GT.M journal fencing commands ZTSTART and ZTCOMMIT. </p><p>TSTART or ZTSTART activate transaction fence control. Subsequent SETs and
KILLs across all accessed regions are marked as belonging to a fenced
transaction. The TCOMMIT or ZTCOMMIT commands respectively, close the fenced
transaction and write the TCOMMIT and ZTCOMMIT journal records in all the
journal files of all regions involved in the transaction.</p><p>If a TSTART has been processed, and another TSTART is encountered prior to a
TCOMMIT, then the second TSTART does not cause another fence to be emitted to
the journal file, instead increments a "transaction depth" counter accessible as
$TLEVEL. Succeeding TCOMMIT directives cause decrementing of this transaction
depth counter. The TCOMMIT fence is emitted to the journal file when the
"transaction depth" returns to zero (0) (such occurrences are referred to as
"nested" transactions or sub-transactions). </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The maximum depth of a TP transaction nesting is 127 levels.</p><p>Similarly, if a ZTSTART has been processed, and another ZTSTART is
encountered prior to a ZTCOMMIT, then the second ZTSTART does not cause
another fence to be emitted to the journal file. Instead the second
ZTSTART increments a "transaction depth" counter. Succeeding ZTCOMMIT
directives cause decrementing of this transaction depth counter. The
ZTCOMMIT fence is emitted to the journal file when the "transaction
depth" returns to zero (0) (such occurrences are referred to as "nested"
transactions or sub-transactions). </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The maximum depth of a ZTSTART transaction nesting is 255
levels.</p><p>The command ZTCOMMIT numexpr where numexpr is greater than zero (0),
is functionally equivalent to the code:</p><pre class="programlisting">X "NEW X F X=1:1:numexpr ZTCOMMIT"
</pre><p>and the command ZTCOMMIT 0 is equivalent to the command:</p><pre class="programlisting">ZTCOMMIT $VIEW("JNLTRANSACTION")
</pre><p>This essentially means, ZTCOMMIT 0 closes the transaction, and any and
all open sub-transactions. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Negative values of numexpr are erroneous.</p><p>In case of TSTART/TCOMMIT, journal records for all fenced updates
involved in the transaction are written to journal files of all regions
only during the time of TCOMMIT, that is, only when the TCOMMIT journal
records get written. While, in the case of ZTSTART/ZTCOMMIT, journal
records are written as and when each SET or KILL is encountered in the
fenced transaction.</p><p>While TSTART and TCOMMIT produce transactions with ACID properties
(when certain conventions are followed), ZTSTART and ZTCOMMIT do not
modify M semantics at all. These commands only generate fencing
information in the journals. The M and Z transaction commands cannot be
mixed in a single transaction. MUPIP JOURNAL uses the information
provided by TSTART and TCOMMIT or ZTSTART and ZTCOMMIT, to restore the
entire set of updates that comprise the transaction (unless specifically
instructed to restore only part of the update).</p><p>Using TSTART and TCOMMIT or ZTSTART and ZTCOMMIT significantly
improves the benefit of journaling. When recovering from journal files,
MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER processing by default recovers either all updates
within the transaction fences or none of them, and reports the latter
case during recovery.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In MUPIP documentation, the term transaction means "database
update".</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3" title="Deciding Whether to Use Fencing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="deciding"></a>Deciding Whether to Use Fencing<a class="indexterm" name="id3237271"></a></h4></div></div></div><p>You can fence some, all, or none of your application programs. When you
program with fences, you can still force a recovery to ignore the fences by
using additional qualifiers to MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER. The following lists
advantages and disadvantages for fencing transactions.</p><p>Fencing Advantages:<a class="indexterm" name="id3237398"></a></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Faster recovery</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Minimum risk recovery</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Databases recovered from journals that include fences do not
require post-recovery checks and repairs for logical
consistency</p></li></ul></div><p>Fencing Disadvantages:<a class="indexterm" name="id3237451"></a></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Must be programmed into the M code</p><p>If the application is already structured to minimize logical
transaction breakage problems, inserting the fencing commands may be
a largely mechanical task. In less structured applications,
inserting fences immediately "inside" the M LOCKs associated with
transactions may provide an excellent first approximation of proper
fencing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fencing requires additional CPU resources and adds entries to the
journal file(s)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fencing may duplicate methods of recovery already established to
address these issues</p><p>An application structured so that all information for each logical
transaction is stored in a single global node (while other nodes
hold only redundant information), permits rebuild programs to
completely correct logical inconsistencies. With less restrictive
designs, logical inconsistencies may be corrected manually or by
using semi-automated techniques. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Transaction Fencing and LOCKs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="trans_fenc_locks"></a>Transaction Fencing and LOCKs<a class="indexterm" name="id3237291"></a></h4></div></div></div><p>LOCKs and ZTSTART and ZTCOMMIT transaction fences have an important
relationship. MUPIP JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER assumes that fenced transactions are isolated and
never performs a cascading roll-back. The term cascading roll-back describes
the situation that occurs when dropping one transaction causes previous
transactions to be sequentially dropped, until potentially all transactions
are dropped. If an application violates this assumption, a JOURNAL <span>/</span>RECOVER may create a
database with application-level integrity problems. M LOCKs ensure the
isolation of a sequence of updates from interaction with any other updates.
TSTART and TCOMMIT transaction fences implicitly exhibit the required
isolation whether fences are used with or without associated LOCKs.</p><p>Example of a non-isolated transaction:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Process A                    Process B
---------                    ---------
ZTS
S ^(acct)=^AMT(d,acct)+amt
                             ZTS
                             S ^(acct)=^AMT(d,acct)+amt
                             S (j,^(0))=^JNL(acct,0)+1
                             S ^JNL(acct,j)=stf
                             ZTC
S (j,^(0))=^JNL(acct,0)+1
-- failure --</pre></div><p>These two sets of transactions are not isolated from each other. After the
system fails, Process A's transaction must be removed by a <span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>BACKWARD or not replayed by a
<span>/</span>RECOVER <span>/</span>FORWARD. However, if acct has the same value for
both processes when Process B's transaction is recovered, ^AMT(d,acct)
includes Process A's amt as well as Process B's amt.</p><p>Adding a LOCK to the program (e.g., L ^JNL(acct) just before the ZTSTART
and a LOCK with no argument after the ZTCOMMIT,) isolates the transactions
and prevents the two processes from overlapping. Because M does not treat
the SET command as an atomic database operation, in the absence of
TSTART/TCOMMIT commands, such LOCKs should exist independent of journaling
considerations to protect the updates to ^AMT(d,acct) and ^JNL(0).</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Deciding Whether to Use Journaling </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="titlepage.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Journal File Operations</td></tr></table></div></body>
