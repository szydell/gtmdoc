journaling is ENABLED (or ON). </p>
               <p>  </p>
               <p>The default value of Journal Epoch Interval is 30 seconds. Longer Epoch Intervals can increase run-time

               <p>The default value of Journal Extension is 100. In production, this value should typically be either zero 

(0) to disable journal extensions and rely entirely on the Journal Allocation, or it should be large. In UNIX, this value 

serves largely to allow you to monitor the rate of journal file growth. </p>

               <p>The default value for Journal Yield Limit is 8. On a lightly loaded system, a small value can improve

               <p>Either On or OFF. [WAS ON] OFF means that replication is still working, but a problem with journaling 

has caused GT.M to turn it off, so GT.M is still replicating, but will turn replication OFF if it ever has to turn to the 

journal because the pool has lost data needed for replication. </p>

            </td><td>
               <p>Seconds that GT.M waits for disk space to become available before it ceases trying to flush a GDS 

block's content to disk. During the wait, it sends eight (8) approximately evenly spaced operator log messages before finally 

issuing a GTM-E-WAITDSKSPACE error. For example, if Wait Disk is 80 seconds and GT.M finds no disk space to flush a GDS 

block, it sends a GTM-E-WAITDSKSPACE syslog message about every 10 seconds, and after the eighth message issues a 

WAITDSKSPACE error. This field is only used in Unix because of its reliance on lazy disk space allocation. </p>

            </td><td>
               <p>Acts as a clue for replication update helper processes as to how aggressively they should attempt to 

prefetch blocks. It's an estimate of the number of database blocks that GT.M reads for every 100 update records. The default 

value is 200. For very large databases, you can increase the value up to 400.  </p>

               <p>An approximate percentage (integer value 0 to 100) of the number of global buffers reserved for the 

update process. The reader helper processes leaves at least this percentage of the global buffers for the update process. 

It can have any integer value between 0 to 100. The default value is 50. </p>

            </td><td>
               <p>One of the parameters used by GT.M to manage the database is the flush trigger. One of several 

conditions that triggers normal GT.M processes to initiate flushing dirty buffers from the database global buffer cache is 

when the number of dirty buffers crosses the flush trigger. GT.M processes dynamically tune this value in normal use. In an 

attempt to never require the update process itself to flush dirty buffers, when the number of dirty global buffers crosses 

the update writer trigger factor percentage of the flush trigger value, writer helper processes start flushing dirty buffers 

to disk. It can have any integer value between 0 to 100. The default value is 33, that is, 33%. </p>
