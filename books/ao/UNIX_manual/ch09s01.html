<p>GT.M processes a GDS file using predominantly low-level system services. The GDS file consists of two parts: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>The database file header </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The database itself </p></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="DFH"></a>Database File Header </h3></div></div></div>
<p>The fields in the file header convey the following types of information: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Data Elements </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Master Bitmap </p></li>

<a name="FHDE"></a>File Header Data Elements<a class="indexterm" name="idm46547985160496"></a> </h3></div></div></div>
<p>All GT.M components, except GDE, (the run-time system, DSE, LKE, MUPIP) use the data elements of the file header for 
accounting, control, and logging purposes.</p>
<p>The current state of the file header always determines the characteristics of the database. The MUPIP CREATE command 
initializes the values of the file header data elements from the global directory and creates a new .DAT file. </p>
<p>The file header data elements are listed as follows in alphabetical order for easier access, rather than the order in which 
they appear in the file header. </p>

issuing a WAITDSKSPACE error. For example, if Wait Disk is 80 seconds and GT.M finds no disk space to flush a GDS 
block, it sends a WAITDSKSPACE syslog message about every 10 seconds, and after the eighth message issues a 
WAITDSKSPACE error. This field is only used in UNIX because of its reliance on lazy disk space allocation. </p>

       <p>Acts as a clue for replication update helper processes as to how aggressively they should attempt to 
prefetch blocks. It's an estimate of the number of database blocks that GT.M reads for every 100 update records. The default 
value is 200. For very large databases, you can increase the value up to 400. </p>

       <p>One of the parameters used by GT.M to manage the database is the flush trigger. One of several 
conditions that triggers normal GT.M processes to initiate flushing dirty buffers from the database global buffer cache is 
when the number of dirty buffers crosses the flush trigger. In an attempt to never require the update process itself to flush dirty buffers, when the number of dirty global buffers crosses 
the update writer trigger factor percentage of the flush trigger value, writer helper processes start flushing dirty buffers 
to disk. It can have any integer value between 0 to 100. The default value is 33, that is, 33%. </p>
