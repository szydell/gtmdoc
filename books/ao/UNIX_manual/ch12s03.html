<p>The commands here are all line oriented to illustrate that they can be automated by being called from GT.M or from a shell script. For interactive use, there are many graphical user interfaces (GUIs) usable with GPG. Although these examples were generated on Linux, usage on other UNIX systems should be virtually identical. </p>

<a name="Key_Management"></a>Key Management </h3></div></div></div>
<p>This is an example of key management using GPG and the reference implementation.</p>
<p>Helen Keymaster (helen@gt.m) is the master of keys, and provides a database key to Phil Keyuser (phil@gt.m). Helen does not manage the database. Phil is the database manager, but he is not the master of keys.In order to communicate securely, Helen and Phil each set up a GPG keyring, generate a public / private key pair, and exchange &amp; authenticate each other's public keys. This permits a secure transfer of the key for the symmetric cipher used for the database.Warning: If you attempt key generation on a virtual machine, or other computer system that does not have a good supply of entropy, the gen_key_pair.sh script could take a very, very long time. Similarly, a key quality of 2 for the gen_sym_key.sh script on a machine without a plentiful supply of entropy can also tax your patience. Use a physical computer system with a lot of entropy. If you are able to, use an entropy gathering daemon such as egd (<a class="ulink" href="http://egd.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://egd.sourceforge.net</a>), or consider acquiring an entropy source such as the Entropy Key (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.entropykey.co.uk/" target="_top">http://www.entropykey.co.uk</a>) that you can use to distribute entropy to your virtual machines. </p>
<p> The workflow is as follows: </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Helen and Phil each create a new GPG keyring and a new public-private key pair<sup>[<a name="idm45367097630112" href="ch12s03.html#ftn.idm45367097630112" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>. In the gen_keypair.sh script GPG generates the key pair<sup>[<a name="idm45367097623584" href="ch12s03.html#ftn.idm45367097623584" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup>, putting public and private keys in the key ring; the latter locked with a passphrase. The public key is also exported to a text file, and its fingerprint is displayed in the terminal session. Each of them e-mails (or otherwise sends) her/his public key text file to the other<sup>[<a name="idm45367097622544" href="ch12s03.html#ftn.idm45367097622544" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>. This is illustrated below; first Helen, then Phil (if the GNUPGHOME environment variable is not set, it will default to <code class="code">$HOME/.gnupg</code>).</p>

</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Helen e-mails helen@gt.m_pubkey.txt the file containing her exported public key to Phil, and Phil sends phil@gt.m_pubkey.txt, his exported public key to Helen. To protect against "man in the middle" attacks, they speak on the phone to exchange keyfingerprints, or send each other the fingerprints by text message,or facsimile - a different communication channel than that used to exchange the keys. Phil does likewise with Helen's key. They use the import_and_sign_key.sh shell script. After importing and signing each other's public keys, Phil and Helen can communicate securely with each other, even in the presence of eavesdroppers. Helen's keyring with Phil's imported key is shown below:</p>
<p>
<img src="ao_figures/import_sign_key.png" width="100%">  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Using the gen_sym_key.sh script, Helen generates a symmetric cipher key for Phil to use in encrypting a new database file cust.dat. With a key strength of 2, a symmetric key is suitable for use in production and in the example is stored in file helen_cust_dat.txt encrypted with Helen's public key so that only she can decrypt it. The gen_sym_key.sh script never displays the symmetric cipher key; the key in the text file on disk can only be decrypted with Helen's private key.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>With the encrypt_sign_db_key.sh script, Helen uses her private key to decrypt the symmetric cipher key in helen_cust_dat.txt, encrypts it with Phi's public key, and signs it with her private key, creating a file called phil_cust_dat.txt. She sends this file to Phil, either as an e-mail attachment, or putting it in a mutually agreed upon location on disk. As before, even though the key is on disk, it can be decrypted only with Phil's private key. Note that from this point on, even if Helen is hit by a truck, or resigns, Phil has access to the key and can use the same encrypt_sign_db_key.sh script to provide the key to, say, Xavier, Helen's successor. Helen preparing the key for Phil is shown below. </p>
<p><img src="ao_figures/gen_sym_key.png" width="70%"> 
</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>With the add_db_key.sh script, Phil now adds the key to his GT.M master key file. He can then create the encrypted database file with mupip create, load it with data and use it. Until the database is created and loaded with data, the key has no value and can be discarded at will. Once the database is created and loaded with the data, the key must be retained as long as access to the database - or even a backup thereof - is ever required. The entire process is illustrated below: </p>
<p>      <img src="ao_figures/add_db_key.png" width="80%"></p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>As a final check to make sure that the database was created with the correct symmetric cipher key and the correct cipher, Helen can use the gen_sym_hash.sh script to compute a hash from the key in helen_cust_dat.txt while Phil uses GT.M's dse dump -fileheader -all command to print the key from the file header of the database file he creates. If the hashes match, the database file has been correctly created. </p></li>

He then creates the database file, runs a DSE dump fileheader to extract the hash (highlighted in the output), and sends it to Helen for verification (notice that MUPIP CREATE generates an error for the mumps.dat file that exists already, but creates a new encrypted cust.dat file): </p>

<p>The encrypted database file cust.dat is now ready for use. That file, all journal files, backups, and binary extracts will all have the same symmetric encryption cipher and key, which means that software libraries that provide that cipher and copies of the key (encrypted with the public keys of all those who are authorized to access them) must be retained as long as there may be any need to access data in that database file, its journal files, extracts and backups. </p>
<p>The following command sequence diagram illustrates how Helen and Phil operate with one another.</p>

Running out of entropy can cause the operation to stall until sufficient entropy becomes available.  You may need to consider external entropy sources or entropy gathering daemons for computer systems on which key generation will occur frequently.  For encrypted databases on virtual machines, you may need to generate public-private keypairs on host computers and then ship the keyrings to the virtual guests.</p></div>
