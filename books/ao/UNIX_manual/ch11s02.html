</h2></div></div></div>
<p>If you experience database integrity problems, there are three strategies to
consider when approaching the recovery:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Recover with journaling</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Restore from backup and redo any lost work</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Repair the database</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>To achieve the intended result, correction of database errors requires careful
planning. Each strategy differs from the others in the scope of damage it can
handle, in skills needed, and in database availability.</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="recover_frm_jrnls"></a>Recover from Journals<a class="indexterm" name="idp71067392"></a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Journaling is generally the most attractive approach to recovery from
integrity problems. It allows management of recovery using logical rather than
physical constructs, including suppression of updates based on time and/or
source and preservation of application-level logical transactions. Backward
journal recovery is generally the fastest means of repair. The cost of
journaling is the added load it imposes on normal operation to make and store
the journal files. For more information on journaling, refer to the "GT.M
Journaling" chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="restore_frm_backup"></a>Restore from Backup<a class="indexterm" name="idp71062432"></a>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Restoring the database from the backup is the least technically sophisticated
approach to handling integrity problems. This strategy is most beneficial when
the data in the database is static or can be recomputed. In other cases, it
requires operational controls to identify, and people to reenter, the work
performed between the backup and the failure. For more information on MUPIP
BACKUP, RESTORE, EXTRACT, and LOAD, refer to the "MUPIP" chapter. You may also
use 
<span>UNIX utilities such as tar, dump, and restore</span>.</p>
<p>Some database regions may be setup to hold only temporary data, typically only
valid for the life of a GT.M process or even just during some operation
performed by a process. Rather than restoring such a region, it is generally
more appropriate to delete it and recreate it using MUPIP CREATE. </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="repair_with_dse"></a>Repair with DSE</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Database repair with DSE requires more skill, and potentially more time than
the other approaches. Using DSE requires vigilant attention to, and a clear
understanding of, GDS. DSE can generally access and change almost any data in
the database file. When using DSE, you assume the responsibility that GT.M
normally carries for ensuring the integrity of the database structure. Because
DSE may be used concurrently with other processes, updates by concurrent
processes may interfere with repair actions. When possible, prevent other users
from accessing the region during repairs.</p>
<p>If you elect to repair the database, you may want to seek assistance from an
available source of expertise such as FIS or your GT.M
Value Added Reseller (VAR). If your organization plans to perform repairs beyond
straightforward corrections to the file header, FIS 
strongly recommends that the responsible person(s) familiarize themselves with
the material in the INTEG section of the MUPIP chapter, the GDS and DSE
chapters, and this chapter. FIS recommends using DSE
on test files, in advance of any work on production files.</p>

<p>Once you understand the cause of a database integrity problem, you can correct
or improve the environment to prevent or minimize future damage. These changes
may include hardware reconfiguration, such as improving the quality of power;
changes to the operational procedures, such as implementing journaling; and/or
changes to the Global Directories, such as balancing data assignment into files
of more manageable sizes.</p>
<p>Use the following tools to help determine the cause of a database integrity
problem.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Knowledge of the application and how it is used</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Context dumps produced by application programs</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Core dumps produced by application programs</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Core dumps produced by GT.M</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Interviews with users to discover their actions</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Review of all recent changes to hardware, 
<span>UNIX</span>, GT.M, the application,
procedures, etc. </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Copies of damaged files</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The trail from DSE sessions in the form of notes, a script file recording the session,
sequential files, and saved blocks.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<a name="determine_the_cause_of_the_problem"></a>Determining the Cause of the Problem<a class="indexterm" name="idp69431136"></a>
</h4></div></div></div>
<p>The following questions may help you understand the type of information
required to determine the nature of a database integrity problem.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>How seriously are operations affected?</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>What level of urgency do you assign to getting the problem
resolved?</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>What were the circumstances under which the database became
damaged or inaccessible?</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>How was the problem first recognized?</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Examine the accounting logs for information about recent process
terminations. Capture information about what functions were in use. Look for
any information which might be helpful in establishing patterns in case the
problem is repetitive.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Has the system crashed recently? If so, what caused the crash?

</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Is there database damage?</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle">
<li class="listitem"><p>What region(s) are affected? What globals?</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>What are the error messages? </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>What do you see when you examine the database? </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Are you comfortable with fixing the problem? </p></li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>What version of GT.M are you using? What version of UNIX? What
UNIX platform are you running? </p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="chp11_mupip_recovery"></a>MUPIP Recovery<a class="indexterm" name="idp71100416"></a>
</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Bring down the damaged application using appropriate utilities, MUPIP
RUNDOWN <span>-</span>REGION region
or <span>-</span>FILE 
<span>file-name</span> naming
the problem database. Restart the application. Consider writing programs or
procedures to partially automate shutting down one or all applications; to
reduce the chance of errors.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="follow_up_chapter11_mupip_recovery"></a>Follow-up</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Make sure to transfer any relevant files or reports  to FIS. Please also communicate
any information regarding the circumstances surrounding the problem,
including the answers to the questions above. Consider the following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Has any hardware or software component of your system recently
changed?</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Was anyone doing anything new or unusual? </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Was the problem preceded or followed by any other notable events?
</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Did you have any unusual problems during the analysis or recovery?
</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Do you have any suggestions about this procedure? </p></li>
