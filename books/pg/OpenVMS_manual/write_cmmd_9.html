      <p>The WRITE command transfers a character stream specified by its arguments to the current device.</p>
      <p>The format of the WRITE command is:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">
	W[RITE][:tvexpr] expr|*intexpr|fcc[,...]
	</pre>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>The optional truth-valued expression immediately following the command is a command postconditional that controls whether or not GT.M executes the command.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>An expression argument supplies the text of a WRITE.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When a WRITE argument consists of a leading asterisk (*) followed by an integer expression, WRITE outputs one character associated with the ASCII code specified by the integer evaluation of the expression.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>WRITE also accepts format control characters as arguments; format control characters modify the position of a virtual cursor: an exclamation point (!) produces the device specific record terminator (for example, new line for a terminal), a number sign (#) produces device specific page terminator (for example, form feed for a terminal) and a question mark (?) followed by an expression moves the virtual cursor to the column specified by the integer evaluation of the expression if the virtual cursor is to the &quot;left&quot; of the specified column.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When directed to a device bound to a mnemonicspace, WRITE also accepts controlmnemonics, which are keywords specific to the binding – they are delimited by a slash (/) prefix and optionally followed by a parenthetical list of arguments. The parentheses &quot;( )&quot; are optional when there are no arguments, but must appear even if there is a single argument</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>An indirection operator and an expression atom evaluating to a list of one or more WRITE arguments form a legal argument for a WRITE.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>GT.M can write up to 32,767 bytes (the GT.M maximum string length) as a result of a single WRITE argument. GT.M buffers output into a &quot;logical record&quot; for all devices except <span>mailboxes and sockets without DELIMITERs</span>. The WRITE command appends a string to the current record of the current device. GT.M does not write to the output device until the buffer is full, a GT.M format control character forces a write, a USE command, a CLOSE command, or, for terminals, the buffer becomes stale <span>(the terminal staleness timer is adjustable through GTM$DEFAULTS)</span>.</p>
      <p>Each device has a WIDTH and a LENGTH that define the virtual &quot;page&quot;. The WIDTH determines the maximum size of a record for a device, while the LENGTH determines how many records fit on a page. When the current record size ($X) reaches the maximum WIDTH and the device has WRAP enabled, GT.M starts a new record. When the current line ($Y) reaches the maximum LENGTH, GT.M starts a new page.</p>
      <p>A WRITE with an asterisk preceding the argument, which it would expect to be a decimal ASCII representation, writes the character corresponding to the ASCII representation. The WRITE command also has several format control characters that allow the manipulation of the virtual cursor. For all I/O devices, the GT.M format control characters do the following:</p>
      <p>WRITE !:	Clears $X and increments $Y and terminates the logical record in progress. The definition of &quot;logical record&quot; varies from device to device, and is discussed in each device section.</p>
      <p>WRITE #:	Clears $X and $Y and terminates the logical record in progress.</p>
      <p>WRITE ?n:	If n is greater than $X, writes n-$X spaces to the device, bringing $X to n. If n is less than or equal to $X, WRITE ?n has no effect. When WRAP is enabled and n exceeds the LENGTH of the line, WRITE ?n increments $Y.</p>
      <p>For more information, refer to the sections on specific I/O devices.</p>
