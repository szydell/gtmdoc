        <p>GT.M transaction processing permits the application to specify a set of globals that do not require GT.M to preserve Isolation, one of the &quot;ACID&quot; properties of TP. This shifts the responsibility for Isolation from GT.M to the application logic, and permits GT.M to relax its TP Isolation rules. This avoids TP restarts in certain cases thus improving the performance of the application. For example, if a global variable includes $JOB as a subscript, the application may be written and scheduled in such a way that no more than one process uses a node of that global at any given time. Specifying such a global as &quot;NOISOLATED&quot; avoids transaction restarts that occur when different processes concurrently update and access nodes that share the same GDS block.</p>
        <p>The rules for enforcement by GT.M of Isolation, and therefore potentially Consistency, are relaxed for application-specified global variables in order to allow the application to manage these properties. GT.M is responsible for Atomicity and Durability, as well as for database integrity for all variables, and for Isolation and Consistency for any global variables for which the application does not accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>Note that if an application incorrectly specifies a global to be NOISOLATED, severe, and possibly intermittent and difficult to diagnose damage to application-level integrity is likely to result. A thorough understanding of the application is necessary before declaring a global to be noisolated. GT.M preserves database integrity (accessibility) for NOISOLATED, as well as ISOLATED global variables.</p>
        <p>GT.M ignores attempts to turn on (or off) the feature for globals that already have the feature turned on (or off). It is an error to modify the isolation-status of a global variable within a transaction across different references (either reads or writes) of that global variable.The VIEW command by itself is not considered to be a reference of the global variable. While not recommended programming practice, this means that a process can change a global's isolation-status within a transaction as long as it hasn't referenced it yet.</p>
        <p>Any reads on a NOISOLATION global are validated at the time of the read and not re-validated at TCOMMIT time. This means that if the value that was read changed after the read but before the TCOMMIT, the transaction would still be committed. Therefore it is important that any reads on a NOISOLATED global (if any) should be of data that does not change with time. Sanchez has not identified applications where this could be an issue.</p>
