<p>The ZLINK command adds an executable GT.M routine to the current process if the current process does not contain a copy of a routine. If the current process contains a copy of a routine and the routine is not active, the ZLINK command replaces the current routine process with a "new" version. If necessary, the ZLINK command compiles the routine prior to integrating it with the process.</p>
<p>With VIEW "LINK":"RECURSIVE" specified or by starting the process with the environment variable gtm_link set to "RECURSIVE", the ZLINK command adds an executable routine even when a routine with the same name is active and available in the current stack. When a process links a routine with the same name as an existing routine, future calls use the new routine. Prior versions of that routine referenced by the stack remain tied to the stack until they QUIT, at which point they become inaccessible. This provides a mechanism to patch long-running processes.</p>

<p>The format of the ZLINK command is:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">ZL[INK][:tvexpr] [expr1[:expr2][,...]]</pre>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>The optional truth-valued expression immediately following the command is a command postconditional that controls whether or not GT.M executes the command.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The optional first expression specifies the pathname of a routine to ZLINK; if ZLINK has an argument, it not only adds the routine to the image, but also sets $ZSOURCE=expr.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>If ZLINK has no argument, or expr="", it uses value of $ZSOURCE as the routine <span>specification filename</span>; at least two (2) spaces must follow a ZLINK command with no argument to separate it from the next command on the line.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The optional second expression specifies a string holding MUMPS command qualifiers delimited by a dash (-); the qualifiers control compile options when the current ZLINK requires a compile; if ZLINK omits the second expression, the command uses the $ZCOMPILE intrinsic special variable to determine the compile qualifiers.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>An indirection operator and an expression atom evaluating to a list of one or more ZLINK arguments form a legal argument for a ZLINK.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>When ZLINK encounters a bad object file it produces an INVOBJFILE error that identifies the problem object file.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>When the ZLINK command specifies a file, GT.M sets $ZSOURCE to that filename. By default, ZLINK and ZEDIT use $ZSOURCE for a filename when they have a missing or null argument. A subsequent ZLINK without an argument is equivalent to ZLINK $ZSOURCE. <span>For more information on $ZSOURCE, see the appropriate section in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8.

<p>If the expression includes an explicit directory, ZLINK searches only that directory. Otherwise, if $ZROUTINES is not null, a ZLINK command uses $ZROUTINES to locate files.

<p>If the filename contains an explicit file extension, ZLINK processes the file according to the extension, object (.o) or source (usually .m). If the file name does not specify a file extension, ZLINK attempts to find and match both the object and source for a routine.</p>

<p>If ZLINK compiles a routine and the -OBJECT= qualifier does not redirect the output, it places the resulting object file in the directory indicated by the search criteria. ZLINK incorporates the new object file into the image, regardless of its directory placement.</p>
<p>If the command does not specify compile qualifiers (with expr2) and $ZCOMPILE is null, GT.M uses the default M command qualifiers, -ignore, -labels=lower, -nolist, and -object. <span>For more information on $ZCOMPILE, refer to the appropriate section in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Intrinsic Special Variables">Chapter 8: &#8220;<i><span>Intrinsic Special Variables</span></i>&#8221;</a>.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt;ZLINK "test"</pre>
<p>If ZLINK finds test.m or test.o, it adds the routine test to the current image. If ZLINK does not find test.o, or finds that test.o is older than test.m, GT.M compiles test.m to produce a new test.o, and adds the contents of the new object file to the image. This example assumes "test" is not on the current M stack - if it is on the stack, GT.M gives an error.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt;zlink "test.m":"-noobject -list"</pre>
<p>This compiles the routine "test" and produces a listing but no object file. Because the example produces no object file, it must locate an existing object file (which might be the same as any copy in the current image); if there is noexisting object file, GT.M produces an error. While this example shows the use of compilation qualifiers with ZLINK, a -noobject -list compilation might better be done with ZCOMPILE.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt;zlink "sockexamplemulti2"
%GTM-E-LOADRUNNING, Cannot ZLINK an active routine sockexamplemulti2
GTM&gt;zshow "S"
sockexamplemulti2+12^sockexamplemulti2    (Direct mode)
GTM&gt;view "LINK":"RECURSIVE"
GTM&gt;zlink "sockexamplemulti2"

<p>If a GT.M routine refers to a routine that is not linked in the process memory, GT.M automatically attempts to ZLINK that routine. An auto-ZLINK is functionally equivalent to an explicit ZLINK of a routine without a specified directory or file extension.</p>

<p>This section describes the procedure to setup the auto-relink functionality. GT.M loads an object file linked from an object directory (in $ZROUTINES) with a *-suffix (i.e. auto-relink-enabled) into a shared memory segment (referred to henceforth as a Rtnobj shared memory segment). At the invocation of DO, GOTO, or ZGOTO, extrinsic functions, ZBREAK, ZPRINT or $TEXT() that specify an entryref which includes a routine name (in contrast to a label without a routine name), GT.M processes (and MUPIP processes executing trigger logic) automatically relink ("auto-relink") and execute published new versions of routines.</p>

<p>The ZRUPDATE command publishes of new versions of routines to subscribers. To remove routines, delete the object files and publish the names of the deleted object files. Removal requires file names to be explicitly specified, because patterns with wildcards cannot match deleted files.</p>
<p>If the path to a file is non-existent, the request is ignored except in the case where one desires a currently shared object file (one that was accessed before it was deleted) to no longer be shared. </p>
<p>For each auto-relink enabled directory which a GT.M process accesses while searching through $ZROUTINES, GT.M creates a small control file (Relinkctl) in the directory identified by $gtm_linktmpdir (defaulting to $gtm_tmp, which in turn defaults to /tmp, if unspecified). The names of these files are of the form gtm-relinkctl-&lt;murmur&gt; where &lt;murmur&gt; is a hash of the realpath() to an auto-relink directory; for example: <code class="code">/tmp/gtm-relinkctl-f0938d18ab001a7ef09c2bfba946f002)</code>. With each Relinkctl file, GT.M creates and associates a block of shared memory that contains associated control structures. Among the structures is a cycle number corresponding to each routine found in the routine directory; a change in the cycle number informs a process that it may need to determine whether there is a new version of a routine. Although GT.M only creates relinkctl records for routines that actually exist on disk, it may increment cycle numbers for existing relinkctl records even if they no longer exist on disk.</p>
<p>GT.M creates both the Relinkctl file and shared memory with permissions based on the logic described in the "IPC Permissions" column of the "Shared Resource Authorization Permissions" section in the Administration and Operations Guide, except that the object directory, rather than the database file, provides the base permissions.</p>
<p>The MUPIP RCTLDUMP command reports information related to relinkctl files and their associated shared memory segments.</p>
<p>The environment variable gtm_autorelink_keeprtn if set to 1, t[rue], or y[es] causes exiting processes to leave auto-relinked object code in the shared memory repositories, while if undefined, 0, f[alse] or n[o] causes exiting processes to purge any routines currently use by no processes. All values are case-independent. When gtm_autorelink_keeprtn is defined and TRUE:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Process exit is simplified, with the performance gain - faster process termination - likely to be observable only when a large number of processes exit concurrently.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Where routines are likely to be repeatedly used by other processes, such as in a production environment, leaving a routine in shared memory even when no longer used by existing processes, results in slightly faster linking of that routine by future processes, although the effect may not be observable except when an application frequently uses short-lived processes, such as GT.M routines invoked by web servers using a CGI interface.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>FIS recommends that a directory in the $zroutines of a process be either auto-relink-enabled or auto-relink-disabled for the life of the process. Changing the auto-relink mode of the directory within a process is likely to result in counter-intuitive results..
</p>
<p>As arguments, ZRUPDATE takes object file names, including wild-cards of the form accepted by $ZSEARCH(). If ZRUPDATE fails to find at least one file to match an argument with a wild card, it issues an INFO message (seen only if $PRINCIPAL has CENABLE). When the argument specifies an explicit name without a wild card, but there is no file in the directory or a corresponding entry in the Relinkctl, ZRUPDATE produces an error. ZRUPDATE issues most errors as FILEPARSE errors with a secondary error describing the actual issue although some errors, depending on the reason and path by which ZRUPDATE detects them, can be rather cryptic.</p>
<p>An explicit ZLINK or an auto-relink check the hash of an object and its replacement. If they are identical, GT.M may take no action to replace the current object, saving both memory and time.GT.M bypasses the dynamic link of a routine when it determines the requested object matches the currently linked object file under either of the following circumstances:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>auto-relink from the same directory</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>explicit ZLINK where neither the original object nor the new object are auto-relinked.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>In other cases GT.M always performs the dynamic link.</p>
<p>An explicit ZLINK from an auto-relink directory acts as an implicit ZRUPDATE.</p>
<p>Any ZBREAK in a routine disables that routine from auto-relinking by a process until all ZBREAKs are removed.</p>
<p>If recursive relink is not enabled, routines currently active in the M virtual machine stack are disabled from auto-relinking until they complete (or are removed from the stack by a ZGOTO).</p>
<div class="sect3">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="auto_ben_exm"></a>Auto-zlink Benefits and Example</h4></div></div></div>
<p>The benefits of auto-relink are as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Auto-relink provides the convenience of automatically running the current routine under most conditions. </p>
<p>When combined with VIEW "LINK":"RECURSIVE", auto-relink automatically relinks routines even when they are active and available in the current stack. While it is possible to run auto-relink without VIEW "LINK":"RECURSIVE", routines currently active in a stack do not auto-relink and, if explicitly ZLINK'd, induce a LOADRUNNING error until they complete or are removed from the stack.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Use of auto-relink loads routine object files into the shared memory. Therefore, the use of a given routine by multiple processes results in significant memory savings (one copy per system instead of one copy per user). This is analogous to the memory sharing from using shared object libraries, but allows dynamic updates, where shared libraries do not.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>When combined with routines explicitly compiled with the -embed_source option or auto-compiled with $ZCOMPILE set to "-embed_source", auto-relink may improve the performance of $TEXT() and ZPRINT as they access source code from shared memory instead of the disk.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>When $gtm_autorelink_keeprtn is defined and TRUE, applications that frequently invoke GT.M routines in short running processes (such as those over interfaces like CGI) may give better performance because it keeps routines in shared memory so that they can be reused when short running processes need them.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The use and setup of the auto-relink facility depends upon the requirements. Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">$ /usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/gtm
GTM&gt;w $zroutines
/home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/o*(/home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/r /home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/r) /usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/plugin/o/_POSIX.so /usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/plugin/o(/usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/plugin/r) /usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/libgtmutil.so /usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64</pre>
<p>In $ZROUTINES, the *-suffix after the object directory enables the auto-relink facility. By default, the gtm/gtmprofile scripts that are available as part of GT.M distribution on sourceforge.net have auto-relink enabled.</p>
<p>With auto-relink enabled, GT.M loads an object file from an object directory into Rtnobj shared memory segment on an explicit ZLINK, implicit ZLINK (DO, GOTO, ZPRINT, $TEXT()), and extrinsic function invocations ($$) enabling the routines to be accessed by other concurrent/future processes.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note: Note">

<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
<p>With auto-relink, GT.M creates an initial Rtnobj shared memory segment of 1 MiB (2 MiB or more if hugepages is configured) and allocates 92MiB of shared memory segment for managing the auto-relink facility. Therefore, always ensure that your system has adequate shared memory configured; if not, GT.M displays messages along the lines of: </p>
<pre class="programlisting">%GTM-E-SYSCALL, Error received from system call shmget() failed</pre>
<p>Refer to your OS documentation to configure shared memory limits (for example, on common Linux systems, the kernel.shmmax parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf).</p>
<p>If your routines require more MiB shared memory, set the environment variable $gtm_autorelink_shm to an integer value (in powers of two). When auto-relink needs more shared memory for storing routines, GT.M automatically allocates twice the size of $gtm_autorelink_shm MiB for auto-relink operations.</p>

<p>The first invocation of an implicit ZLINK (DO, GOTO ZGOTO, ZPRINT, $TEXT() or function/extrinsic invocation) or an explicit ZLINK "myprogram.m" or ZRUPDATE "/home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/myprogram.o" creates a Relinkctl file if one does not already exist and the associated shared memory. The relinkctl file has a name associated with the hash of the directory to provide a pointer in the form of segment ids to shared memory so that processes can locate routines.</p>
<p>As the gtm_linktmpdir environment variable is not set by default in the gtm/gtmprofile scripts, GT.M stores the Relinkctl file in the directory pointed to by the gtm_tmp environment variable.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt;zshow "A"
Object Directory : /home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/o
Relinkctl filename : /tmp/fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/gtm-relinkctl-43b26ca8384ddbf74b94d90a830c0bc9

<p>ZSHOW "A" command displays information related to relinkctl file and the routine records that it points to in the shared memory segments. The routine records appears in the order in which they were inserted into the shared memory in the context of the relinkctl file.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt;zedit "myprogram2.m"</pre>
<p>ZEDIT puts a new file into the first source directory in $ZROUTINES, that is, in the /home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/r directory.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt; zrupdate "/home/jdoe/.fis-gtm/V6.2-001_x86_64/o/*.o"</pre>
<p>The ZRUPDATE command increments the cycle counter of those routine records whose object hash is different than the one last loaded in the Rtnobj shared memory. In this case, it would be rec#2, that is, myprogram.o. ZRUPDATE does not recompile/relink the routines. Instead, it instructs all current and future processes that the object code is out-of-date and must be auto-relinked (if required) on the next invocation. An explicit ZLINK or an auto-relink (whichever happens first) checks the hash of an object and its replacement and initiates recompile/relink on finding that are they not identical.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">GTM&gt;zshow "A":zru</pre>
<p>If there are hundreds of routines, a command like ZSHOW "A":zru transfers the output of ZSHOW "A" to a local variable. The following example uses that result to display the information on all routines that contain the string passed to the disprtn function:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
GTM&gt;zprint ^disprtn
disprtn(rtn)
set x="" for set x=$order(zru("A",x)) quit:x="" write:$piece(zru("A",x),":",3)[rtn zru("A",x),!
quit ""</pre>
<p>and produces a result like the following:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
GTM&gt;w $$^disprtn("myprogram")
rec#1: rtnname: myprogram2 cycle: 1 objhash: 0x436c855d5891e7cf numvers: 1 objlen: 0x370 shmlen: 0x400
rec#2: rtnname: myprogram cycle: 1 objhash: 0xd81f1cdcc275e13d numvers: 1 objlen: 0x280 shmlen: 0x400

<p>In GT.M, the name of the source file determines the name of the GT.M routine. The file name of the object file is not required to match the name of the routine. Linking the object file makes the internal routine name (derived from the source file) known to GT.M. This can lead to potential confusion, however, since both ZLINK and auto-ZLINK use the name of the object file to find the routine. When the object file name differs from the name of the routine, auto-ZLINK generates a run-time error.</p>
