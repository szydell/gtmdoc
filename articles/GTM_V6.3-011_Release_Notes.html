Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures (the combination of operating system and hardware architecture is referred to as a platform). This set of specific versions is considered Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. This larger set of versions is considered Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable. These are considered Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below. Contact FIS for a current list of Supported platforms. The reference implementation of the encryption plugin has its own additional requirements, should you opt to use it as included with GT.M.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

<p>Only 64-bit versions of AIX with POWER7 as the minimum required CPU architecture level are Supported.</p>
            
<p> While GT.M supports both UTF-8 mode and M mode on this platform, there are problems with the AIX ICU utilities that prevent FIS from testing 4-byte UTF-8 characters as comprehensively on this platform as we do on others. </p>
            
<p> Running GT.M on AIX 7.1 requires APAR IZ87564, a fix for the POW() function, to be applied. To verify that this fix has been installed, execute <code class="code"> instfix -ik IZ87564. </code> </p>

<p>Only the AIX jfs2 filesystem is Supported. Other filesystems, such as jfs1 are Supportable, but not Supported. FIS strongly recommends use of the jfs2 filesystem on AIX; use jfs1 only for existing databases not yet migrated to a jfs2 filesystem.</p>

<p> To run 64-bit GT.M processes requires both a 64-bit kernel as well as 64-bit hardware. </p>
            
<p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (2.6.32 or later), glibc (version 2.12 or later) and ncurses (version 5.7 or later). </p>
            
<p>Due to build optimization and library incompatibilities, GT.M versions older than V6.2-000 are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora (26), Debian (unstable), and Ubuntu (17.10). In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade.</p>
            
<p> GT.M requires the libtinfo library. If it is not already installed on your system, and is available using the package manager, install it using the package manager. If a libtinfo package is not available:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p> Find the directory where libncurses.so is installed on your system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> Change to that directory and make a symbolic link to libncurses.so.&lt;ver&gt; from libtinfo.so.&lt;ver&gt;. Note that some of the libncurses.so entries may themselves be symbolic links, for example, libncurses.so.5 may itself be a symbolic link to libncurses.so.5.9.</p></li></ul></div>
            
<p>To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x.</p>
            
<p>Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3" target="_blank">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3</a>). The Red Hat Bugzilla identifier for the bug is 1213487. With NODEFER_ALLOCATE, do not use any filesystem other than ext4 and a kernel with the fix, or xfs.</p>

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use. If your installation uses both modes, consider a similar pattern for structuring application object code repositories.</p><p>GT.M is installed in a parent directory and a utf8 subdirectory as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Actual files for GT.M executable programs (mumps, mupip, dse, lke, and so on) are in the parent directory, that is, the location specified for installation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Object files for programs written in M (GDE, utilities) have two versions - one compiled with support for UTF-8 mode in the utf8 subdirectory, and one compiled without support for UTF-8 mode in the parent directory.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="GTMchng_hist"></a> Change History</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="V6.3-011"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMtaV63-011ble"></a>V6.3-011</h3></div></div></div><p>Fixes and enhancements specific to V6.3-011:</p><p></p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Id</strong></span></p>              </th><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Prior Id</strong></span></p>              </th><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Category</strong></span></p>              </th><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>              </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-3035">GTM-3035</a></p></td><td><p>S9A04-001538</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p> <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/chkmrkb.png" alt="[!alert!]"></span>  Additional information in NOPRINCIO message and related behavior normalized <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-4041">GTM-4041</a></p></td><td><p>C9B12-001849</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>Please see <a class="link" href="#GTM-3035">GTM-3035</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-8398">GTM-8398</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Admin</p></td><td><p>Support larger database extensions <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9036">GTM-9036</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>Recognition of terminal disconnects of a PRINCIPAL device <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9136">GTM-9136</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>Available standard behavior for WRITE # <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9215">GTM-9215</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>Reading an ISV does not result in a NUMOFLOW</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9222">GTM-9222</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>$TEXT() of a literal designating the routine it's in OK as 1st value in $SELECT() and with -DYNAMIC_LITERALS</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9223">GTM-9223</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>Remove conflict between TLS SOCKETs and PIPE Devices</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9225">GTM-9225</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Admin</p></td><td><p>gtmprofile uses pkg-config in preference to icu-config to determine the icu version number</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9226">GTM-9226</a></p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>Language</p></td><td><p>Fix $[Z]TRANSLATE() result length when manipulating UTF-8 strings with NOBADCHAR </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-9228">GTM-9228</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Other</p></td><td><p>Remove geteuid executable from GT.M distributions</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Language"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp163993200"></a>Language </h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><a name="GTM-3035"></a> Loss of the PRINCIPAL device ($PRINCIPAL) in base Direct Mode is silent, this includes completion of HEREDOC input from a script; previously the behavior differed by device.

Unable to dddd principal device: DDDD at LLLL due to: SSSS</p><p>Run Time Fatal: This indicates that GT.M attempted to, but could not, READ from, or WRITE to (direction indicated by dddd), the PRINCIPAL device, and therefore attempted to issue an appropriate error, for example, an IOEOF, TERMHANGUP, or TERMWRITE at location LLLL, with a status of SSSS. However, if the error handling does not prevent any and all subsequent READs and WRITEs to the no longer available PRINCIPAL device, the next subsequent I/O error shuts down the process immediately to prevent mysteriously lost output, or, worse, an indefinite loop. The NOPRINCIO message appears in the operator log</p><p>Action: The NOPRINCIO error message is FATAL which does not drive device or trap handlers and terminates the process. This termination does not allow any application level orderly shutdown and, depending on the application, may lead to out-of-design application state. Therefore FIS recommends appropriate application level error handling that recognizes the preceding error and performs an orderly shutdown without issuing any additional READ or WRITE to the principal device. The most common causes for the principal device to cease to exist involve terminal sessions or socket connections (including those from processes started by inetd/xinetd).  When the remote client terminates the connection, the underlying PRINCIPAL device becomes inaccessible making any subsequent attempt to READ from, or WRITE to, it hopeless. In the case of terminals, a user closing the window of a session without cleanly exiting from the GT.M process sets up the case that can drive this error. GT.M does not issue NOPRINCIO errors from Direct Mode, because it is a developer tool, or at the completion a HEREDOC in a shell script. However, this means a HEREDOC must use ZHALT to return a specific status to the shell, and that a $ETRAP that bounces a process into Direct Mode terminates without evidence.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="TERMHANGUP  "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMTERMHANGUP"></a>TERMHANGUP <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/new.png" alt="New"></span>  </h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>TERMHANGUP, </strong></span>
Terminal has disconnected</p><p>Run Time Error: This indicates that the terminal serving as the PRINCIPAL device has disconnected. By default, GT.M ignores terminal "hang-ups," which can allow the terminal to reconnect at a later time to a process that does not need the terminal to continue work. You can enable recognition of Principal device disconnects with USE $PRINCIPAL:HUPENABLE or by starting the process with the gtm_hupenable set to 1, TRUE or YES, or disable them with USE $PRINCIPAL:NOHUPENABLE.</p><p>Action: When a process receives this error it must avoid any further READs from, or WRITEs to, $PRINCIPAL, typically by shutting down in a wholesome fashion. Failure to do so causes GT.M to terminate the process with a NOPRINCIO message to the operator log.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="TRANS2BIG  "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMTRANS2BIG"></a>TRANS2BIG <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/revised.png" alt="Revised"></span>  </h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>TRANS2BIG, </strong></span>
 Transaction exceeded available buffer space for region rrrr</p><p>Run Time Error: This indicates that a transaction updated more blocks than the global buffers could hold (half - 2) for a particular region rrrr or accessed more than the single transaction limit of 64Ki blocks.</p><p>Action: Look for missing TCOMMIT commands; modify the code to reduce the total content or change content of the transaction. If the transaction is as intended and the issue is the number of updates, increase the GLOBAL_BUFFERS for the region using MUPIP SET, or modify the Global Directory to redistribute the relevant globals to more regions. If this occurs on a replicating instance it may indicate either a difference in configuration between the originating and replicating instances, which probably should be addressed, or a transaction that was borderline on the originating instance, but failed on the replicating instance because of difference in the database layout. In the later case, consider examining the application code to see if it's possible to reduce the size of the transaction, or alternatively increase the global buffers on both the instances.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
