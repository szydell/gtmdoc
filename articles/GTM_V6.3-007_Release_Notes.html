Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures (the combination of operating system and hardware architecture is referred to as a platform). This set of specific versions is considered Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. This larger set of versions is considered Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable. These are considered Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below. Contact FIS for a current list of Supported platforms.

<p> IBM Power Systems AIX </p>

<p> 7.1 TL 4, 7.2 </p>
          </td><td>

<p>Only 64-bit versions of AIX with POWER7 as the minimum required CPU architecture level are Supported.</p>

<p> While GT.M supports both UTF-8 mode and M mode on this platform, there are problems with the AIX ICU utilities that prevent FIS from testing 4-byte UTF-8 characters as comprehensively on this platform as we do on others. </p>

<p> Running GT.M on AIX 7.1 requires APAR IZ87564, a fix for the POW() function, to be applied. To verify that this fix has been installed, execute <code class="code"> instfix -ik IZ87564. </code> </p>

<p>AIX 7.1 TL 5 is Supportable.</p>

<p>Only the AIX jfs2 filesystem is Supported. Other filesystems, such as jfs1 are Supportable, but not Supported. FIS strongly recommends use of the jfs2 filesystem on AIX; use jfs1 only for existing databases not yet migrated to a jfs2 filesystem.</p>

<p> x86_64 GNU/Linux </p>
          </td><td>

<p> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5; Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</p>
          </td><td>

<p> To run 64-bit GT.M processes requires both a 64-bit kernel as well as 64-bit hardware. </p>

<p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (2.6.32 or later), glibc (version 2.12 or later) and ncurses (version 5.7 or later). </p>

<p>Due to build optimization and library incompatibilities, GT.M versions older than V6.2-000 are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora (26), Debian (unstable), and Ubuntu (17.10). In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade.</p>

<p> GT.M requires the libtinfo library. If it is not already installed on your system, and is available using the package manager, install it using the package manager. If a libtinfo package is not available:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p> Find the directory where libncurses.so is installed on your system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> Change to that directory and make a symbolic link to libncurses.so.&lt;ver&gt; from libtinfo.so.&lt;ver&gt;. Note that some of the libncurses.so entries may themselves be symbolic links, for example, libncurses.so.5 may itself be a symbolic link to libncurses.so.5.9.</p></li></ul></div>

<p>To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x.</p>

<p>Although GT.M itself does not require libelf, the geteuid program used by the GT.M installation script requires libelf (packaged as libelf1 on current Debian/Ubuntu distributions and elfutils-libelf on RHEL 6 &amp; 7).</p>

<p>Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3" target="_blank">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3</a>). The Red Hat Bugzilla identifier for the bug is 1213487. With NODEFER_ALLOCATE, do not use any filesystem other than ext4 and a kernel with the fix, or xfs.</p>

<p> This 32-bit version of GT.M runs on either 32- or 64-bit x86 platforms; we expect the x86_64 GNU/Linux version of GT.M to be preferable on 64-bit hardware. Running a 32-bit GT.M on a 64-bit GNU/Linux requires 32-bit libraries to be installed. The CPU must have an instruction set equivalent to 586 (Pentium) or better.</p>

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use. If your installation uses both modes, consider a similar pattern for structuring application object code repositories.</p><p>GT.M is installed in a parent directory and a utf8 subdirectory as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Actual files for GT.M executable programs (mumps, mupip, dse, lke, and so on) are in the parent directory, that is, the location specified for installation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Object files for programs written in M (GDE, utilities) have two versions - one compiled with support for UTF-8 mode in the utf8 subdirectory, and one compiled without support for UTF-8 mode in the parent directory. Installing GT.M generates both versions of object files, as long as ICU 3.6 or greater is installed and visible to GT.M when GT.M is installed, and you choose the option to install UTF-8 mode support. Note that on 64-bit versions of GT.M, the object code is in shared libraries, rather than individual files in the directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The utf8 subdirectory has files called mumps, mupip, dse, lke, and so on, which are relative symbolic links to the executables in the parent directory (for example, mumps is the symbolic link ../mumps).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When a shell process sources the file gtmprofile, the behavior is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>If $gtm_chset is "m", "M" or undefined, there is no change from the previous GT.M versions to the value of the environment variable $gtmroutines.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If $gtm_chset is "UTF-8" (the check is case-insensitive),</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="square"><li class="listitem"><p>$gtm_dist is set to the utf8 subdirectory (that is, if GT.M is installed in /usr/lib/fis-gtm/gtm_V6.3-007_i686, then gtmprofile sets $gtm_dist to /usr/lib/fis-gtm/gtm_V6.3-007_i686/utf8).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On platforms where the object files have not been placed in a libgtmutil.so shared library, the last element of $gtmroutines is $gtm_dist($gtm_dist/..) so that the source files in the parent directory for utility programs are matched with object files in the utf8 subdirectory.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div

After the cause of the SIGBUS has been addressed, the process may turn statistics database logging back on by doing a VIEW "STATSHARE":"REGION", at which point the process returns to doing updates to the corresponding statistics database. Previously, a GT.M process that received a SIGBUS while trying to do statistics database logging terminated, producing a core file. Additionally, when a GT.M process changes between private and shared statistics collection, it copies the current statistics into the appropriate statistics location so collected statistics persist. Previously, GT.M did not properly copy over process-private statistics, meaning that switching over to a statistics database lost any previously collected statistics.

Previously, GT.M used a combination of multiple operating system facilities and its own logic to provide this protection. Several ZSHOW "G" mnemonics behave differently with this change.

CFT and CFE are maintained, but are only incremented a single time for each observed instance of contention, whereas previously it counted the number of low-level synchronization operations performed, which would typically have been significantly larger.

   Extension exceeds maximum total blocks, not extending</p><p>Run Time Error: This indicates that the database file extension specified implicitly or explicitly (using MUPIP EXTEND) would cause the GDS file to exceed its maximum size. Please see the most recent GT.M Release Notes, Upgrading to GT.M [LatestVersion], Stage 2:Database File Upgrades section, Important bullet for maximum database sizes.</p><p>Action: Modify the extension to use a smaller size.

 Transaction exceeded available buffer space for region rrrr</p><p>Run Time Error: This indicates that a transaction updated more blocks than the global buffer could hold for a particular region rrrr or accessed more than the single transaction limit of 64K blocks.</p><p>Action: Look for missing TCOMMIT commands; modify the code to reduce the total content or change content of the transaction. If the transaction is as intended and the issue is the number of updates, increase the GLOBAL_BUFFERS for the region using MUPIP SET, or modify the Global Directory to redistribute the relevant globals to more regions. If this occurs on a replicating instance it may indicate either a difference in configuration between the originating and replicating instances, which probably should be addressed, or a transaction that was borderline on the originating instance, but failed on the replicating instance because of difference in the database layout. In the later case, consider examining the application code to see if it's possible to reduce the size of the transaction, or alternatively increase the global buffers on both the instances.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="UNIQNAME  "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMUNIQNAME"></a>UNIQNAME <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/new.png" alt="New"></span>  </h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>UNIQNAME, </strong></span>
