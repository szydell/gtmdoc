Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures, we refer to the combination of operating system and hardware architecture as a platform. We deem this set of specific versions: Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. We deem this larger set of versions: Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable and therefore deem them: Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below.

<p> Running GT.M on AIX 7.1 requires APAR IZ87564, a fix for the POW() function, to be applied. To verify that this fix has been installed, execute <code class="code"> instfix -ik IZ87564. </code> </p>

<p> To run 64-bit GT.M processes requires both a 64-bit kernel as well as 64-bit hardware. As of V7.1-001, GT.M on x86-64 requires hardware/virtualized support for AVX instructions. </p>
            
<p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (2.6.32 or later), glibc (version 2.12 or later) and ncurses (version 5.7 or later). </p>
            
<p>Due to build optimization and library incompatibilities, GT.M versions older than V6.2-000 are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora (26), Debian (unstable), and Ubuntu (17.10). In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade.</p>
            
<p> GT.M requires a compatible version of the libtinfo library. On Red Hat, the ncurses-libs and ncurses-compat-libs packages contain the libtinfo library. On Debian/Ubuntu, libtinfo5 and libncurses5 packages contain the libtinfo library. If any of these packages is not already installed on your system, please install using an appropriate package manager. </p>
            
<p>To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x or later.</p>
            
<p>Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3" target="_blank">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3</a>). The Red Hat Bugzilla identifier for the bug is 1213487. With NODEFER_ALLOCATE, do not use any filesystem other than ext4 and a kernel with the fix, or xfs.</p>
            
<p>Our testing has shown an interaction between glibc 2.36 and all versions of GT.M on Linux/x86_64 systems without AVX2 support. This can cause segmentation violations (SIG-11) in processes performing concurrent updates to the same database block, which terminate the process, but do not damage the database. The issue is due to the way glibc performs certain memory operations when using SSE2 instructions. The glibc behavior was subsequently modified to avoid this issue, and the change was included in glibc 2.37, however, we have not yet confirmed the change resolved issue. Linux/x86_64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions are not vulnerable, as glibc chooses its AVX2 implementation, when available, over its SSE2 implementation, and the problematic behavior is specific to SSE2. Note, depending on how CPU virtualization is configured, that virtual environments may not support AVX2 even if the underlying hardware does.</p>

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div

Previously, due to a regression in V6.3-005, it was possible for the Update Process to miss closing a prior journal file when a MUPIP SET switched a journal file and the Update Process was waiting to receive updates from the Receiver Server.

Previously, REORG failed to visit certain categories of blocks, including the root block and blocks it newly created or modified, and it required an indefinite number of passes to achieve optimal block structure. As a workaround for previous releases, users may consider repeating REORG operations until the command reports few blocks coalesced and split. In addition, REORG now recognizes a new qualifier, -MIN_LEVEL=n, which specifies the minimum level of block it may process. The default is -MIN_LEVEL=0. -MIN_LEVEL=1 instructs reorg only to process index blocks and can be understood as the REORG equivalent of an INTEG -FAST.

Previously, GT.M would sometimes fail to split these blocks, which prevented the original lower data- or index-level split from taking place. Together, these could prevent REORG from enforcing the provided fill factor and/or reserved bytes setting; a failure which persisted on all subsequent attempts, or until the database structure has changed as a result of new updates. As a workaround, users of previous releases can address a subset of the failures-to-split by passing a slightly different -fill_factor, provided that reserved bytes are disabled.

Previously, GT.M failed to reject a combination of reserved bytes and -fill_factor which effectively reserved a space larger than the database block size and caused database damage. Users of previous releases should use either reserved bytes or -fill_factor, but not both, as a means of achieving REORG sparseness.

In the WAS_ON state, replication continues until and unless replication requires records that are no longer available from the replication journal pool, as it can no longer use the journal files to find those records. While in this WAS_ON state if you can resume journaling, you may be able to avoid having to refresh the associated Secondary Instances. The need to use journal files in replication is a function of the size the replication journal pool, the rate of updates and operator actions that impact replication. Previously, GT.M issued a REPLJNLCLOSED message when journaling was disabled for a database file, but did not indicate that the replication status changed to WAS_ON.

Previously GT.M did not provide the flexibility to set these values independently. The -RESERVED_BYTES qualifier continues to adjust both types of block to the same value. When the command specifies -RESERVED_BYTES along one of the more specific qualifiers, MUPIP applies the more general -RESERVED_BYTES value to the block type unspecified by the other qualifier. MUPIP DUMPFHEAD reports the number of bytes reserved for each type of block (as does DSE DUMP -FHEAD). Reserving additional bytes in index blocks can reduce the number of records in any given index block and may reduce invalidation and search restarts in some workloads.

These qualifiers affect the TCP send and receive buffers associated with the socket GT.M uses for replication, rather than the receive/journal pools. When invoked with -{SEND|RECV}BUFFSIZE=n, where n is a positive decimal or hexadecimal (0x) integer, GT.M attempts to increase the specified socket buffer size to match the provided value. If the specified buffer is already larger than the provided value, GT.M does not attempt to reduce its size. By default, GT.M attempts to increase the size of the send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) or receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) if either is smaller than the internal target value specified below.</p><pre class="programlisting">
                SO_SNDBUF    SO_RCVBUF
Source          1MiB         1KiB
Receiver        1KiB         1MiB
</pre><p>If a user requests a size for either buffer smaller than necessary to support GT.M replication, GT.M will print a BUFFSIZETOOSMALL warning, act as if the minimum size had been specified instead, and continue. Due to a quirk in how the Linux kernel reports socket buffer sizes, users of GT.M on Linux can expect GT.M to report a final size approximately twice what is requested; the additional space is used internally by the kernel. When invoked with -NO{SEND|RECV}BUFFSIZE, GT.M leaves the management of the initial size of the specified buffer to the execution environment, including the system defaults, local configuration settings, and operating system. In some cases, such as when the operating system dynamically manages the size of the relevant buffers, this can may lead to better performance in conditions which call for larger sizes than the GT.M default. Previously GT.M enforced a fixed minimum size for each buffer and did not permit the explicit request of receive and send buffer sizes. In addition, GT.M now correctly sets the buffer sizes, when warranted, before establishing a connection. Previously, GT.M waited until after the source and receiver had established a connection to perform any modification of the buffer sizes, which prevented the TCP connection from taking full advantage of any increase in size.

When using TLS configuration verify-mode options SSL_VERIFY_PEER and SSL_VERIFY_POST_HANDSHAKE, GT.M enables TLSv1.3 PHA for server connections. By itself, SSL_VERIFY_POST_HANDSHAKE does not enable PHA. Previously, GT.M did not support TLSv1.3's PHA capability. This could cause problems when connecting to some TLSv1.3 servers that require PHA.
