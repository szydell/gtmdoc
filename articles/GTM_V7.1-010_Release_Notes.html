Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures, we refer to the combination of operating system and hardware architecture as a platform. We deem this set of specific versions: Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. We deem this larger set of versions: Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable and therefore deem them: Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below. Contact FIS for a current list of Supported platforms.

<p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (5.14 or later), glibc (version 2.34 or later) and ncurses (version 6.2 or later). As of V7.1-001, GT.M on x86-64 requires hardware/virtualized support for AVX instructions. </p>
            
<p><span class="bold"><strong>glibc 2.41+</strong></span> GT.M versions V7.1-000 and older are incompatible with executable stack restrictions introduced in glibc 2.41. GT.M versions V7.1-001 and newer are compatible. For example, this affects Ubuntu 25.04 and up. RHEL 9, RHEL 10 and Amazon Linux 2023 are unaffected. </p>
            
<p><span class="bold"><strong>glibc 2.36+</strong></span> GT.M versions V6.2-001 and older are incompatible with glibc 2.36 on Linux/x86_64 systems without AVX2 support. GT.M versions V6.2-002 and newer are compatible. This interaction was discovered during routine testing. This can cause segmentation violations (SIG-11) in processes performing concurrent updates to the same database block, which terminate the process, but do not damage the database. The issue is due to the way glibc performs certain memory operations when using SSE2 instructions. The glibc behavior was subsequently modified to avoid this issue, and the change was included in glibc 2.37. Linux/x86_64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions are not vulnerable, as glibc chooses its AVX2 implementation, when available, over its SSE2 implementation, and the problematic behavior is specific to SSE2. Note, depending on how CPU virtualization is configured, that virtual environments may not support AVX2 even if the underlying hardware does. </p>
            
<p><span class="bold"><strong>glibc 2.24+</strong></span> GT.M versions V6.1-000 and older are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up due to build optimization and library incompatibilities. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade. </p>
            
<p><span class="bold"><strong>libconfig 1.4+ is required</strong></span> To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x or later. </p>
            
<p><span class="bold"><strong>File Systems:</strong></span> Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you must ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3). The Red Hat Bugzilla identifier for the bug is 1213487. With NODEFER_ALLOCATE, do not use any filesystem other than ext4 and a kernel with the fix, or xfs. </p>

FIS's ability to provide an appropriate level of support may become increasingly costly to the client.

The additional costs required would be maintain client release level specific servers, operating systems and other ancillary software for a given and reasonable time frame beyond the normal window. </p><p>FIS policy is only to provide remediation, in the current release, for identified issues in generally available and supported releases.

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="GTMchng_hist"></a> Change History</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="V7.1-010"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMtaV71-010ble"></a>V7.1-010</h3></div></div></div><p>Fixes and enhancements specific to V7.1-010:</p><p></p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Id</strong></span></p>              </th><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Prior Id</strong></span></p>              </th><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Category</strong></span></p>              </th><th>                <p><span class="bold"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>              </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-5910">GTM-5910</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Admin</p></td><td><p>DSE dump -block -count command uses correct record numbers when displaying consecutive blocks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-6837">GTM-6837</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Admin</p></td><td><p>The Receiver Server terminates Update process and Helpers upon port bind failure, preventing orphans</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-10091">GTM-10091</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>DB</p></td><td><p> <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/images/chkmrkb.png" alt="[!alert!]"></span> GT.M protects against process id reuse for M-locks and journaling/DB critical sections</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11030">GTM-11030</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Admin</p></td><td><p>MUPIP SET -FLUSH_TIME command, when successful, prints a message indicating the new timer value <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11063">GTM-11063</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>DB</p></td><td><p>Address poor KILL cleanup performance in database regions partially upgraded from V5/6 to V7 format</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11345">GTM-11345</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Other</p></td><td><p>ACIDTP characteristic for external calls <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11382">GTM-11382</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Other</p></td><td><p>Protection of LOCK resource names against rare, but fatal issue</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11390">GTM-11390</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>DB</p></td><td><p>CRD statistic tracks blocks retrieved from global buffers <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/images/chkmrkg.png" alt="[!New Feature!]"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11435">GTM-11435</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>DB</p></td><td><p>Protect against a RECOVER/ROLLBACK crossing V5/6 to V7 database upgrade boundary</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a class="link" href="#GTM-11448">GTM-11448</a></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>DB</p></td><td><p>Improve Block utilization and prevent premature expansion </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Database"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id693"></a>Database </h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><a name="GTM-10091"></a> GT.M protects against process id reuse when checking whether a process holding a shared resource is still active while holding M-Locks, journaling or database critical sections, or performing database truncation. GT.M only does such checks when a shared resource remains unavailable for an unexpected long period. Previously, particularly on AIX, an unrelated process that acquired the same process id as a process id that was previously involved in one of these activities could prevent GT.M from recovering an abandoned shared resource. Administrators may need to increase LOCK_SPACE up to 50% due to this enhancement.

The change to level 0 blocks has no material value nor does the corresponding INTEG check. In addition, DSE handles CHANGE -FILEHEADER -FULLY_UPGRADED and either -BLKS_TO_UPGRADE or -DB_WRITE_FMT independently and flushes file header changes immediately. Also, MUPIP INTEG reports a disagreement between Fully Upgraded and Blocks to Upgrade. Starting with V7.1-000, a KILL on an upgraded database involving many blocks performed poorly. The workaround was to use DSE for the region at issue to change -fileheader -blks_to_upgrade=0 followed by change -fileheader -fully_upgraded=1. Previously DSE could implicitly update Fully Upgraded when changing Blocks to Upgrade or -DB_WRITE_FMT, and MUPIP INTEG did not report misalignment between Fully Upgraded and Blocks to Upgrade.

The statistic is designed to represent the number of cache 'hits' and provide a way of calculating the cache hit rate (CRD / (CRD + DRD)).
