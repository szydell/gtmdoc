Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures (the combination of operating system and hardware architecture is referred to as a platform). This set of specific versions is considered Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. This larger set of versions is considered Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable. These are considered Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below. Contact FIS for a current list of Supported platforms. The reference implementation of the encryption plugin has its own additional requirements, should you opt to use it as included with GT.M.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

                <p> Running GT.M on AIX 7.1 requires APAR IZ87564, a fix for the POW() function, to be applied. To verify that this fix has been installed, execute <code class="code"> instfix -ik IZ87564. </code> </p>

                <p> To run 64-bit GT.M processes requires both a 64-bit kernel as well as 64-bit hardware. </p>
                <p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (2.6.32 or later), glibc (version 2.12 or later) and ncurses (version 5.7 or later). </p>
                <p>Due to build optimization and library incompatibilities, GT.M versions older than V6.2-000 are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora (26), Debian (unstable), and Ubuntu (17.10). In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade.</p>
                <p> GT.M requires the libtinfo library. If it is not already installed on your system, and is available using the package manager, install it using the package manager. If a libtinfo package is not available:</p>

                <p>To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x.</p>

                <p>Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3" target="_blank">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3</a>).

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use. If your installation uses both modes, consider a similar pattern for structuring application object code repositories.</p><p>GT.M is installed in a parent directory and a utf8 subdirectory as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Actual files for GT.M executable programs (mumps, mupip, dse, lke, and so on) are in the parent directory, that is, the location specified for installation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Object files for programs written in M (GDE, utilities) have two versions - one compiled with support for UTF-8 mode in the utf8 subdirectory, and one compiled without support for UTF-8 mode in the parent directory.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net/" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="GTMchng_hist"></a> Change History</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="V6.3-006"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMtaV63-006ble"></a>V6.3-006</h3></div></div></div><p>Fixes and enhancements specific to V6.3-006:</p><p></p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

Previously, under certain circumstances, LOCK requests could be granted to multiple processes simultaneously, or handle certain conditions inappropriately, leading to segmentation violations (SIG-11). This change requires additional memory per lock slot, so administrators should monitor lock slots (LKE SHOW) to determine whether their usage indicates a need to increase lock space.</p><p>GT.M handles rare issues with LOCK structures by allocating an additional shared memory segment to contain them. GT.M removes this shared memory segment along with the primary database shared memory automatically.</p><p>LKE supports the CLNUP command, which specifies that LKE process the lock space to remove any abandoned artifacts left by processes that exited without releasing their LOCKs. This processing also checks for evidence any entry has been misplaced by an "overflow" condition; it if finds any, it attempts to correct it, and, if it cannot, it produces a MLKHASHTABERR warning message. Such a message indicates the need to stop all access to (at least) the affected region, use MUPIP SET to set, and, if appropriate raise, the -LOCK_SPACE; because MUPIP SET -LOCK_SPACE is a standalone operation, using it, even with the current value, ensures the database is completely quiescent. Then resume operations. LKE CLNUP supports the -PERIODIC=n qualifier which specifies that LKE perform a cleanup every n seconds, which, if you desire active cleanup, is much lighter weight than repeated invocations of LKE from a shell script. FIS suggests running LKE CLNUP -PERIODIC=n with a value of n that appears to prevent growth in the elements in the lock space as reported by LKE SHOW over substantial periods of time. You stop When LKE CLNUP -PERIODIC with a MUPIP STOP &lt;pid&gt;. LKE CLNUP supports the -INTEG qualifier, which specifies that it validate the integrity of the lock space and reports any issues.

If the timeout is zero, GT.M treats it as it would a DO of the vector. The optional labelref specifies a code vector defining a fragment of M code to which GT.M transfers control as if with a DO when the timeout expires. If the timeout is missing, the assignment must start with a colon and only changes the vector, and in this case, if the vector is the empty string, GT.M removes any current vector. Note that GT.M only recognizes interrupts, such as those from $ZTIMEOUT at points where it can properly resume operation, for example, at the beginning of a line, when waiting on a command with a timeout, or when starting a FOR iteration. When a ztimeout occurs, if the last assignment specified no vector, GT.M uses the current $ETRAP or $ZTRAP with a status warning of ZTIMEOUT.

Previously, GT.M eventually gave an error when attempting use the routine. The -OBJECT compilation qualifier used without the -NAMEOFRTN qualifier implicitly names the first routine to match the name of the object qualifier. Note that, as before, listing files take on the name of the source rather than the name of the routine, and the -NAMEOFRTN or -OBJECT qualifiers in $ZCOMPILE are problematic to use with ZLINK commands as they apply to every ZLINK argument. Previously the qualifier applied to all files specified by the same MUMPS or ZCOMPILE command such that all sources received the same object name, which meant the last file was the only one that endured. Also, ZCOMPILE, as documented, accepts qualifiers in its argument prior to the routine list; previously it did not. ZCOMPILE with a wildcard works reliably; previously it stopped compiling routines after encountering a large source file In addition, the MUMPS and ZCOMPILE commands default file specifications without a .m file extension to have one and they only compile files with a .m extension; previously they did not, although some other facilities did require a .m file extension for source files. As before, explicit ZLINK of a source (.m) file always places the object in the same directory as the specified source.  While we are not aware of customers with a practice of using non .m extensions or module names that are not valid M names at compilation, but subsequently rename the object modules, this change requires revision of such practices.

For C external calls, to prevent memory leaks when returning any pointer types, GT.M requires the application to allocate returns of these types using gtm_malloc. Note that using the standard malloc for these types (or not explicitly allocating at all) produces a GTM-F-ASSERT. For Java external calls, the plugin manages any necessary allocations. Previously, GT.M had the ability to return any of the documented types, however the GT.M Programmer's Guide did not document the ability to return anything other than an integer status or a long (for Java calls). Additionally, even though GT.M had the ability to return a range of types, it did not perform the appropriate check for available space in the string pool when returning gtm_char_t*, gtm_char_t**, or gtm_string_t*, which could lead to unpleasant symptoms including a segmentation violation (SIG-11) or incorrect results. Also, attempting to return null values from a C external call results in a %GTM-E-XCRETNULLREF error, and attempting to return null from a Java external call results in a %GTM-E-JNI error.

Journal file jjjj nearing maximum size, nnnn blocks to go</p><p>Run Time Information: Depending on your settings for ALLOCATION, AUTOSWITCHLIMIT, and EXTENSION journaling options, you may see one to three JNLSPACELOW messages for each generation of a journal file. When the difference between AUTOSWITCHLIMIT and ALLOCATION is an exact multiple of EXTENSION, GT.M attempts to write the JNLSPACELOW message to the operator log three times as a journal file reaches its maximum size. The first JNLSPACELOW message appears in the operator log when the available free space (blocks) in a journal file is equal to twice the EXTENSION, the second appears when the available free space is equal to EXTENSION, and the third appears when the journal file reaches the maximum size (AUTOSWITCHLIMIT).  With EXTENSION=0 or EXTENSION=AUTOSWITCHLIMIT, GT.M logs the JNLSPACELOW message only once per journal file to the operator log. </p><p>Action: The JNLSPACELOW message is an information message and requires no action. However, you can use the JNLSPACELOW messages as part of monitoring journaling space requirements or as an operational practice to a trigger to intervene in journal file management. Use the frequency of JNLSPACELOW messages to proactively monitor how fast a journal file grows and as part of a monitoring alorithm that helps predict how soon the disk is likely to hit a quota limit. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="JNLSTATE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMJNLSTATE"></a>JNLSTATE<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/revised.png" alt="Revised"></span></h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>JNLSTATE, </strong></span>
