Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures, we refer to the combination of operating system and hardware architecture as a platform. We deem this set of specific versions: Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. We deem this larger set of versions: Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable and therefore deem them: Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below.

<p>Only 64-bit versions of AIX with POWER7 as the minimum required CPU architecture level are Supported.</p>
            
<p> While GT.M supports both UTF-8 mode and M mode on this platform, there are problems with the AIX ICU utilities that prevent FIS from testing 4-byte UTF-8 characters as comprehensively on this platform as we do on others. </p>
            
<p> Running GT.M on AIX 7.1 requires APAR IZ87564, a fix for the POW() function, to be applied. To verify that this fix has been installed, execute <code class="code"> instfix -ik IZ87564. </code> </p>
            
<p>Only the AIX jfs2 filesystem is Supported. Other filesystems, such as jfs1 are Supportable, but not Supported. FIS strongly recommends use of the jfs2 filesystem on AIX; use jfs1 only for existing databases not yet migrated to a jfs2 filesystem.</p>

          </td><td>
            
<p> To run 64-bit GT.M processes requires both a 64-bit kernel as well as 64-bit hardware. </p>
            
<p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (2.6.32 or later), glibc (version 2.12 or later) and ncurses (version 5.7 or later). </p>
            
<p>Due to build optimization and library incompatibilities, GT.M versions older than V6.2-000 are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora (26), Debian (unstable), and Ubuntu (17.10). In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade.</p>
            
<p> GT.M requires a compatible version of the libtinfo library. On Red Hat, the ncurses-libs and ncurses-compat-libs packages contain the libtinfo library. On Debian/Ubuntu, libtinfo5 and libncurses5 packages contain the libtinfo library. If any of these packages is not already installed on your system, please install using an appropriate package manager. </p>
            
<p>To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x or later.</p>
            
<p>Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3" target="_blank">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3</a>). The Red Hat Bugzilla identifier for the bug is 1213487. With NODEFER_ALLOCATE, do not use any filesystem other than ext4 and a kernel with the fix, or xfs.</p>
            
<p>Our testing has shown an interaction between glibc 2.36 and all versions of GT.M on Linux/x86_64 systems without AVX2 support. This can cause segmentation violations (SIG-11) in processes performing concurrent updates to the same database block, which terminate the process, but do not damage the database. The issue is due to the way glibc performs certain memory operations when using SSE2 instructions. The glibc behavior was subsequently modified to avoid this issue, and the change was included in glibc 2.37, however, we have not yet confirmed the change resolved issue. Linux/x86_64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions are not vulnerable, as glibc chooses its AVX2 implementation, when available, over its SSE2 implementation, and the problematic behavior is specific to SSE2. Note, depending on how CPU virtualization is configured, that virtual environments may not support AVX2 even if the underlying hardware does.</p>

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use. If your installation uses both modes, consider a similar pattern for structuring application object code repositories.</p><p>GT.M is installed in a parent directory and a utf8 subdirectory as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Actual files for GT.M executable programs (mumps, mupip, dse, lke, and so on) are in the parent directory, that is, the location specified for installation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Object files for programs written in M (GDE, utilities) have two versions - one compiled with support for UTF-8 mode in the utf8 subdirectory, and one compiled without support for UTF-8 mode in the parent directory.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div

Previously, this situation would result in out-of-order execution of certain operations and could produce an incorrect truth value. This construction was discovered in "fuzzer" testing, and machine code scans of several million lines of mumps source code did not reveal any instances of this issue in application code. As part of these changes, GT.M provides the option of eliminating all Boolean short-circuiting by setting 'extended Boolean' with the environment variable gtm_boolean=3. Under this setting, GT.M evaluates all operations in a Boolean expression from left to right, even those without visible side effects. The Boolean expression itself is evaluated only after all operands. Enabling this setting comes with a serious performance cost.
