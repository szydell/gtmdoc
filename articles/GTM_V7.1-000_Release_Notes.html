Vendors obsolete hardware architectures. New versions of operating systems replace old ones. We at FIS continually evaluate platforms and versions of platforms that should be Supported for GT.M. In the table below, we document not only the ones that are currently Supported for this release, but also alert you to our future plans given the evolution of computing platforms. If you are an FIS customer, and these plans would cause you hardship, please contact your FIS account executive promptly to discuss your needs. </p><p>Each GT.M release is extensively tested by FIS on a set of specific versions of operating systems on specific hardware architectures, we refer to the combination of operating system and hardware architecture as a platform. We deem this set of specific versions: Supported. There may be other versions of the same operating systems on which a GT.M release may not have been tested, but on which the FIS GT.M Group knows of no reason why GT.M would not work. We deem this larger set of versions: Supportable. There is an even larger set of platforms on which GT.M may well run satisfactorily, but where the FIS GT.M team lacks the knowledge to determine whether GT.M is Supportable and therefore deem them: Unsupported. Contact FIS GT.M Support with inquiries about your preferred platform.</p><p>As of the publication date, FIS supports this release on the hardware and operating system versions below.

<p>Only 64-bit versions of AIX with POWER7 as the minimum required CPU architecture level are Supported.</p>
            
<p> While GT.M supports both UTF-8 mode and M mode on this platform, there are problems with the AIX ICU utilities that prevent FIS from testing 4-byte UTF-8 characters as comprehensively on this platform as we do on others. </p>
            
<p> Running GT.M on AIX 7.1 requires APAR IZ87564, a fix for the POW() function, to be applied. To verify that this fix has been installed, execute <code class="code"> instfix -ik IZ87564. </code> </p>
            
<p>Only the AIX jfs2 filesystem is Supported. Other filesystems, such as jfs1 are Supportable, but not Supported. FIS strongly recommends use of the jfs2 filesystem on AIX; use jfs1 only for existing databases not yet migrated to a jfs2 filesystem.</p>

          </td><td>
            
<p> To run 64-bit GT.M processes requires both a 64-bit kernel as well as 64-bit hardware. </p>
            
<p> GT.M should also run on recent releases of other major Linux distributions with a contemporary Linux kernel (2.6.32 or later), glibc (version 2.12 or later) and ncurses (version 5.7 or later). </p>
            
<p>Due to build optimization and library incompatibilities, GT.M versions older than V6.2-000 are incompatible with glibc 2.24 and up. This incompatibility has not been reported by a customer, but was observed on internal test systems that use the latest Linux software distributions from Fedora (26), Debian (unstable), and Ubuntu (17.10). In internal testing, processes either hung or encountered a segmentation violation (SIG-11) during operation. Customers upgrading to Linux distributions that utilize glibc 2.24+ must upgrade their GT.M version at the same time as or before the OS upgrade.</p>
            
<p> GT.M requires a compatible version of the libtinfo library. On Red Hat, the ncurses-libs and ncurses-compat-libs packages contain the libtinfo library. On Debian/Ubuntu, libtinfo5 and libncurses5 packages contain the libtinfo library. If any of these packages is not already installed on your system, please install using an appropriate package manager. </p>
            
<p>To support the optional WRITE /TLS fifth argument (the ability to provide / override options in the tlsid section of the encryption configuration file), the reference implementation of the encryption plugin requires libconfig 1.4.x or later.</p>
            
<p>Only the ext4 and xfs filesystems are Supported. Other filesystems are Supportable, but not Supported. Furthermore, if you use the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature, FIS strongly recommends that you use xfs. If you must use NODEFER_ALLOCATE with ext4, you <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> ensure that your kernel includes commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 (search for d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3" target="_blank">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.3</a>). The Red Hat Bugzilla identifier for the bug is 1213487. With NODEFER_ALLOCATE, do not use any filesystem other than ext4 and a kernel with the fix, or xfs.</p>
            
<p>Our testing has shown an interaction between glibc 2.36 and all versions of GT.M on Linux/x86_64 systems without AVX2 support. This can cause segmentation violations (SIG-11) in processes performing concurrent updates to the same database block, which terminate the process, but do not damage the database. The issue is due to the way glibc performs certain memory operations when using SSE2 instructions. The glibc behavior was subsequently modified to avoid this issue, and the change was included in glibc 2.37, however, we have not yet confirmed the change resolved issue. Linux/x86_64 systems with support for AVX2 instructions are not vulnerable, as glibc chooses its AVX2 implementation, when available, over its SSE2 implementation, and the problematic behavior is specific to SSE2. Note, depending on how CPU virtualization is configured, that virtual environments may not support AVX2 even if the underlying hardware does.</p>

On a system that does not have ICU 3.6 or later installed, GT.M only supports M mode.</p><p>On a system that has ICU installed, GT.M optionally installs support for both M mode and UTF-8 mode, including a utf8 subdirectory of the directory where GT.M is installed. From the same source file, depending upon the value of the environment variable gtm_chset, the GT.M compiler generates an object file either for M mode or UTF-8 mode. GT.M generates a new object file when it finds both a source and an object file, and the object predates the source file and was generated with the same setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset. A GT.M process generates an error if it encounters an object file generated with a different setting of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset than that processes' current value.</p><p>Always generate an M object module with a value of $gtm_chset/$ZCHset matching the value processes executing that module will have. As the GT.M installation itself contains utility programs written in M, their object files also conform to this rule. In order to use utility programs in both M mode and UTF-8 mode, the GT.M installation ensures that both M and UTF-8 versions of object modules exist, the latter in the utf8 subdirectory. This technique of segregating the object modules by their compilation mode prevents both frequent recompiles and errors in installations where both modes are in use. If your installation uses both modes, consider a similar pattern for structuring application object code repositories.</p><p>GT.M is installed in a parent directory and a utf8 subdirectory as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Actual files for GT.M executable programs (mumps, mupip, dse, lke, and so on) are in the parent directory, that is, the location specified for installation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Object files for programs written in M (GDE, utilities) have two versions - one compiled with support for UTF-8 mode in the utf8 subdirectory, and one compiled without support for UTF-8 mode in the parent directory.

The GT.M interface for compression libraries accepts the zlib compression libraries without any need for adaptation. These libraries are included in many UNIX distributions and are downloadable from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib home page</a>. If you prefer to use other compression libraries, you need to configure or adapt them to provide the same API as that provided by zlib.</p><p> If a package for zlib is available with your operating system, FIS suggests that you use it rather than building your own.</p><p> By default, GT.M searches for the libz.so shared library in the standard system library directories (for example, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64). If the shared library is installed in a non-standard location, before starting replication, you must ensure that the environment variable LIBPATH (AIX) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (GNU/Linux) includes the directory containing the library. The Source and Receiver Server link the shared library at runtime. If this fails for any reason (such as file not found, or insufficient authorization), the replication logic logs a DLLNOOPEN error and continues with no compression.</p><p>Although GT.M uses a library such as zlib for compression, such libraries are not FIS software and FIS does not support any compression libraries.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Change History"><div

When a process enters a critical section, it sets the appropriate toggle statistic to '1' and when it leaves the critical section, sets it back to '0'.  GT.M provides toggle statistics designated DEXA, GLB, JNL, MLK, PRC, TRX, ZAD, JOPA, AFRA, BREA, MLBA &amp; TRGA, which are documented in the "ZSHOW" section of the GT.M Programmers Guide. All of the standard GT.M tools and facilities for examining statistics operate on the toggle statistics, and the only operational difference between the toggle statistics and the counter statistics previously provided by GT.M is that, since toggle statistics provide a near real-time report on GT.M process status rather than a cumulative state, they are neither saved on process exit nor loaded on process initialization. Note that we are still considering feedback on these added statistics, so they may be the subject of future changes.

Note that GT.M exposes a timer mechanism for use by external calls that integrates external timer needs with those of GT.M. Note also that GT.M external calls have a configuration option that claims an external call does not change the GT.M signal handling; this option makes signal handling more efficient. As a result of changes in V6.3-006 associated with GTM-7952, an external call could suspend GT.M's timer mechanism for a process, which caused timed operations (HANG, JOB, LOCK, OPEN, READ, and some Z* operations) to suspend indefinitely.

Also, the Source Server allows users to bypass hard connection attempts by specifying zero (0) as the hard-connection-count for more timely logging of the REPLALERT messages as the Source Server bypasses hard connection attempts.

MUPIP FTOK also recognizes the -ONLY qualifier to restrict the output to only the file's ftok; if a file is not valid and accessible, FTOK reports -1 values. By default, the utility provides additional information about the file, including its file ID which provides the basis for the FTOK. In addition, MUPIP FTOK recognizes the -[NO]HEADER qualifier; -ONLY output has no header, but by default other forms include a header that -NOHEADER suppresses. Any existing parsing of the output require adjustments to deal with the additional information and revised spacing. If the database file is unavailable, the utility defaults to the -ONLY behavior. In addition, the utility accepts a space (&lt;SP&gt;) delimited list of files, such as that provided by the use of the * and ? shell wildcard characters. With either the -JNLPOOL or -RECVPOOL qualifier, MUPIP FTOK ignores any files in the list. Note that to minimize ftok collisions, GT.M uses its own ftok generation algorithm. This added functionality in MUPIP FTOK replaces the standalone ftok utility provided in the GT.M distribution; that executable has been removed from the release package. Previously, MUPIP FTOK did not recognize these qualifiers, only processed a single file, and did not show the FTOK in its output. MUPIP SEMAPHORE reports the details of the a space delimited list of semaphores IDs. This replaces the undocumented standalone semstat2 utility in the GT.M distribution; that executable has been removed from the release package.

Unable to dddd principal device: DDDD at LLLL due to: SSSS</p><p>Run Time Fatal: This indicates that GT.M attempted to, but could not, READ from, or WRITE to (direction indicated by dddd), the PRINCIPAL device, and therefore attempted to issue an appropriate error, for example, an IOEOF, TERMHANGUP, or TERMWRITE at location LLLL, with a status of SSSS. However, if the error handling does not prevent any and all subsequent READs and WRITEs to the no longer available PRINCIPAL device, the next subsequent I/O error shuts down the process immediately to prevent mysteriously lost output, or, worse, an indefinite loop. The NOPRINCIO message appears in the operator log</p><p>Action: The NOPRINCIO error message is FATAL which does not drive device or trap handlers and terminates the process. This termination does not allow any application level orderly shutdown and, depending on the application, may lead to out-of-design application state. Therefore FIS recommends appropriate application level error handling that recognizes the preceding error and performs an orderly shutdown without issuing any additional READ or WRITE to the principal device. The most common causes for the principal device to cease to exist involve terminal sessions or socket connections (including those from processes started by inetd/xinetd). When the remote client terminates the connection, the underlying PRINCIPAL device becomes inaccessible making any subsequent attempt to READ from, or WRITE to, it hopeless. In the case of terminals, a user closing the window of a session without cleanly exiting from the GT.M process sets up the case that can drive this error. GT.M does not issue NOPRINCIO errors from Direct Mode, because it is a developer tool, or at the completion of a HEREDOC in a shell script. However, this means a HEREDOC must use ZHALT to return a specific status to the shell, and that a $ETRAP that bounces a process into Direct Mode terminates without evidence.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="REPLALERT  "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="GTMREPLALERT"></a>REPLALERT   </h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>REPLALERT, </strong></span>

Could not back shared memory with huge pages, using base pages instead</p><p>All GT.M Components Warning: When the gtm_hugetlb_shm environment variable is defined and evaluates to a non-zero integer or any case-independent string or leading substring of ""TRUE"" or ""YES"" in a process creating shared memory, GT.M attempts to back all such shared memory segments with huge pages, using the default huge pages size. If huge pages cannot be used, GT.M outputs the SHMHUGETLB warning and tries to back the shared memory with base pages instead. The warning message specifies the operation of the caller along with the relevant file path for the process requesting shared memory. The warning message also includes either an ENOMEM or an EPERM error, depending on why the request for huge pages failed.</p><p>Action: If the warning includes an ENOMEM error, consider allocating more huge pages. If the EPERM error is specified, make sure the caller is privileged (i.e. has the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability) and is a member of the sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group group.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
